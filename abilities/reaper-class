"Reaper" Class
Core Theme: Drawing strength from the cycles of growth and harvest, the Reaper wields magic inspired by the vitality of the land and the determination to defend it. They combine powerful offensive magic with defensive durability, embodying the dual role of a harvester and protector.

Abilities and Mechanics
Harvest-Driven Magic:

Abilities are tied to the cycle of planting, growth, and harvest, symbolizing preparation, growth, and culmination in battle.
Damage-dealing abilities often have secondary effects that heal or buff allies.
Themes of Resilience and Renewal:

Frontline durability is achieved through spells that regenerate health or convert damage taken into healing or buffs for themselves and allies.
Examples of Signature Spells:

"Scythe of the Harvester": Conjures an ethereal blade to sweep through enemies in an arc, dealing heavy damage and restoring a portion of health to nearby allies.
"Field of Renewal": Creates a glowing patch of energy on the battlefield. Enemies within the field are slowed and weakened, while allies gain regeneration and boosted defense.
"Threshing Storm": Summons a storm of magical energy (e.g., golden stalks and whirling wind) that damages enemies and boosts the Reaper’s power for a short duration.
"Fury of the Harvest": A flashy, high-impact ability that unleashes a powerful wave of destructive energy, symbolizing the culmination of effort. This fits as the move Ethan uses against Arceon’s forces.
Supportive Aspects:

"Planting the Seeds": Buff allies with a protective barrier or increased strength, symbolizing investing in their growth.
"Reap the Spoils": After defeating enemies, absorb residual energy to recover health or gain temporary buffs, emphasizing the cycle of life and death.
Visual Aesthetics
Magic takes on a vibrant, natural look, with glowing golden hues or green vitality streaks. Effects like ethereal stalks of grain, scythe-shaped energy arcs, or ripples of earth connect the abilities to the harvest theme.
The character wields magic with an agricultural motif, emphasizing tools of labor (like scythes or plows) as weapons of battle.
Personality Alignment:
This class emphasizes grit and hard work, much like the process of cultivating a field. It fits a devotee of Merithera, blending the protective and nurturing aspects of the harvest with the raw power required to defend it.
