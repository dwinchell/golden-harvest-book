The Verdant Pact
Location: Deep within lush, untamed forests and dense jungles, bordering Elaris. Their territory is filled with ancient, towering trees, hidden groves, and sacred springs.
Relationship with the Gods:
The Verdant Pact formally pledges to gods with nature-aligned domains, such as Merithera (Harvest), Nyssara (Shadow), and even Siphona (Decay), acknowledging both the creation and destruction inherent in nature.
Their pledging ceremonies are profound and spiritual, involving elaborate rituals in sacred groves where the tribe offers their loyalty and vows to maintain balance in the natural world.
Culture:
Deeply spiritual and connected to the land, they see themselves as stewards of nature, tasked with preserving the harmony of life and death.
Their society is led by shamans who act as intermediaries between the tribe and their gods, interpreting divine will and guiding pledging ceremonies.
They have a strong oral tradition, passing down myths of the gods and lessons about living in harmony with the wild.
Key Characteristics
Pledging and Beliefs:

Every member of the Verdant Pact is expected to pledge to a god as part of their transition into adulthood. The choice is influenced by personal affinities, but the gods of nature are held in highest regard.
They believe that by pledging formally, they gain the favor necessary to protect their people and maintain their sacred duty to the wilds.
Rituals and Practices:

Sacred groves are at the heart of their rituals, adorned with carvings of their gods’ symbols and surrounded by offerings of food, flowers, and animal totems.
Their rituals often involve blood sacrifices—not to kill, but to honor the gods by offering their life essence.
Military and Defense:

The Verdant Pact’s warriors are skilled in ambush tactics, blending seamlessly with the forest.
They wield weapons crafted from the natural world, such as bows with vines that enhance their arrows or spears tipped with magically sharpened stone.
Symbol:

A tree with roots encircling a sun and moon, representing the unity of life, death, and rebirth.
Potential Role in the Story
Protagonist’s Allies:

The Verdant Pact could support Elaris as natural stewards, sharing their deep understanding of balance and harmony.
They might guide the protagonist through the wilderness or grant him access to sacred sites.
Cultural Contrast:

Their reverence for both creation and destruction could contrast with the more rigid beliefs of Elaris and the ambition of Valthar.
Antagonism with Valthar:

Valthar’s exploitation of natural resources and disregard for balance could put them at direct odds with the Verdant Pact.
The tribe might sabotage Valthar’s operations or launch guerrilla attacks on their borders.
