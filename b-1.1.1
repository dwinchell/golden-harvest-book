Ethan Cross stumbled as the world shifted violently around him, his vision blurring into a kaleidoscope of colors. The ground beneath his feet disappeared, and for a heart-stopping moment, he was weightless, suspended in an endless void. His breath caught in his throat, a strangled cry lost in the swirling vortex of light and sound.

Then, as suddenly as it had begun, the chaos ceased.

Ethan landed hard on his hands and knees, the impact jarring his bones. His surroundings snapped into focus: a dense, shadowy forest bathed in twilight, the air heavy with an earthy, unfamiliar scent. Towering trees stretched toward the darkening sky, their gnarled branches twisting like skeletal fingers. Somewhere in the distance, a faint breeze rustled the leaves, its sound oddly soothing despite the alien environment.

“What the hell just happened?” Ethan muttered, his voice shaky. He pressed his palms against the cold, damp ground, trying to steady himself. His heart pounded as he pushed himself upright, taking in the surreal scene around him.

He was no longer in his apartment. Gone were the familiar hum of his computer and the comforting clutter of his gaming setup. In their place was a world that looked ripped straight from one of the fantasy games he loved—except this was no game. The cool breeze on his face and the ache in his knees told him this was real. Too real.

Ethan rubbed his temples, his thoughts racing. The last thing he remembered was falling asleep after an exhausting day at work. Now he was here, wherever "here" was. The air tasted different, fresher, yet tinged with something metallic. He couldn’t shake the sensation that he was being watched.

A soft chime interrupted his spiraling thoughts.

Welcome to the System.

The words hovered before him in glowing white text, suspended in midair. Ethan froze, his breath catching. He reached out instinctively, and his hand passed through the letters as though they were made of light.

“What the…?” He frowned, his confusion deepening.

The text dissolved, replaced by a new message.

Status Screen Activated.

Ethan blinked as a translucent interface materialized in front of him, filled with details he didn’t immediately comprehend. His name, Ethan Cross, was listed at the top, followed by basic stats: Health: 100, Mana: 50, and Level: 1. Below that were slots for skills and abilities, most of them empty except for one: Arcane Pulse (Rank 1).

He stared at the screen, his mouth dry. “This… this is like a game,” he whispered, his voice barely audible. A surge of disbelief mixed with excitement coursed through him. “Am I… in a System world?”

The realization hit him like a bolt of lightning. He’d read stories about this—people transported to other worlds with game-like mechanics. It was a trope he loved, but experiencing it firsthand was a different story entirely. The excitement was quickly drowned by a wave of anxiety. He was alone, unarmed, and utterly unprepared.

Before he could process further, a low, guttural growl pierced the stillness of the forest.

Ethan’s blood ran cold. His eyes darted toward the source of the sound, and he spotted movement among the trees. A pair of glowing, sickly green eyes emerged from the shadows, followed by a hulking, canine-like figure. The creature’s flesh was mottled and rotting, patches of fur clinging to its gaunt frame. Its claws raked the ground, and its snarling mouth dripped with a dark, viscous fluid.

“Blightling Wolf,” Ethan whispered, the name appearing unbidden in his mind. He didn’t know how he knew it, but the words felt as natural as breathing. His hands trembled as he took a step back, his mind screaming at him to run.

The wolf crouched, muscles coiling as it prepared to lunge.

“Move, Ethan!” he yelled to himself, his legs finally obeying. He stumbled backward, nearly tripping over a root as the wolf sprang toward him.

System Notification: Combat Initiated.

A faint golden glow enveloped his body, and he felt a surge of energy. Instinct took over as he raised his hand and focused on the single ability listed in his status screen: Arcane Pulse.

The air around his palm shimmered as a ball of golden energy formed, crackling with raw power. Without thinking, he thrust his hand forward. The energy shot out in a blinding arc, striking the wolf mid-air. The creature let out a guttural yelp as the blast sent it sprawling to the ground.

Ethan gasped, his heart hammering in his chest. “It worked,” he muttered, barely believing it. But the victory was short-lived. The wolf staggered to its feet, snarling more ferociously than before. Its eyes burned with rage, and Ethan realized it was far from defeated.

The wolf charged again, faster this time. Ethan dodged to the side, his body moving with surprising agility. He fired another Arcane Pulse, the blast grazing the creature’s side and leaving a smoldering mark. The wolf faltered but didn’t stop, swiping at him with razor-sharp claws.

The claws caught his arm, and pain seared through him. His health bar, now visible in the corner of his vision, dropped by a quarter. “Damn it!” he hissed, clutching his arm.

Desperation surged as the wolf closed in. Ethan focused, summoning another Arcane Pulse with shaking hands. This time, he aimed directly at the wolf’s head. The golden energy streaked forward, hitting its target with a deafening crack.

The creature collapsed, its body dissolving into ash-like particles. The glowing green eyes dimmed and vanished, leaving only the faint hum of the forest.

Ethan fell to his knees, his chest heaving. Sweat dripped down his face as he stared at the spot where the wolf had fallen. His health bar flashed red, but it began to regenerate slowly. The System chimed again.

Combat Complete. XP Gained.

A new notification appeared: Level Up!

Ethan stared at the glowing text, his exhaustion giving way to a flicker of triumph. For a moment, he allowed himself to breathe, the reality of his situation sinking in.

He was alive. For now.
