Here’s a draft of the scene where Merithera visits Ethan in a dream and seeks his consent:

### The Dream

Ethan sat on the edge of a familiar cliff, staring out at a dark, roiling sea. The sky above him was an oppressive gray, mirroring the storm that churned inside his chest. Below, waves smashed against jagged rocks, their thunderous crashes drowning out his thoughts. Shadows flickered at the edges of his vision—manifestations of his fears and failures. He saw the faces of his parents, twisted in anger. The cold, unfeeling walls of his apartment loomed over him. His boss’s voice cut through the chaos, sharp and demeaning, and his own reflection stared back at him with tired, hollow eyes.

He buried his head in his hands, wishing it would all stop.

Then, suddenly, the world stilled.

The sea calmed, the shadows faded, and the oppressive gray softened into a warm, golden light. Ethan looked up, startled, as a figure stepped into view—a woman, radiant and serene, her presence filling the space with a profound peace. She wore a flowing gown of golden-green, adorned with intricate patterns that resembled stalks of wheat. Her hair shimmered like sunlight, and her eyes held the depth of endless fields.

“Ethan,” she said, her voice gentle yet commanding, like the first breeze of spring.

“Who... who are you?” Ethan’s voice trembled, a mix of awe and confusion.

“I am Merithera,” she said, kneeling before him. “The keeper of cycles, the nurturer of growth. I have watched you, seen your struggles, your pain. You have endured much. But tell me, Ethan—do you not wish for more?”

Her words struck something deep within him, a raw nerve that brought tears to his eyes. He tried to speak, but the lump in his throat held him silent. Finally, he managed to whisper, “I do... I just don’t know how.”

Merithera extended a hand, and the vision of his anxieties—his parents, his job, his loneliness—reappeared, flickering like ghosts. With a gentle wave, they disintegrated into motes of golden light, leaving behind only the calm sea and the warm glow of her presence.

“You deserve more,” she said softly. “But the choice is yours.”

Ethan blinked, suddenly aware that he was dreaming. The surreal quality of the moment became clear, and doubt crept into his voice. “This... this can’t be real. You’re just a figment of my mind. Aren’t you?”

Merithera smiled, the corners of her lips curling with a motherly warmth. “If you think so, then wake.”

Her voice, now layered with a divine resonance, thundered softly through the dream. “Wake.”

### The Awakening

Ethan shot upright in his bed, his heart racing. The room was dark, but not entirely. A golden glow illuminated the corners, casting soft light over the worn furniture. He turned his head and froze.

She was there.

Merithera stood by his bedside, her radiance both comforting and overwhelming. She seemed both tangible and otherworldly, as if she existed in a place just beyond the bounds of reality. 

“You are awake,” she said, her tone steady, yet tinged with a weight of purpose. “And now, I ask again, Ethan: Do you want more from life?”

Ethan’s mind reeled, but somehow, he knew this was no hallucination. “I... I do,” he said, his voice breaking. “But what does that mean? Who are you really?”

“I am the goddess of the Harvest,” she said, stepping closer. “And I have need of you. The world I guard is in turmoil, and I seek a soul who can nurture it, defend it, and grow within it. That soul, Ethan, is you.”

He stared at her, incredulous. “A goddess... You’re telling me you want to take me to another world?”

“Yes,” she said simply. “A world unlike this one, yet perhaps not so different from the stories you know. It may remind you of fictional worlds you’ve imagined. But make no mistake—it is real. There will be no second chances, no respawns, no way to return.”

Ethan’s breath caught. “Why me? I’m... I’m no one.”

“You are more than you see yourself to be,” she said, her gaze softening. “You have a heart that yearns for better, a spirit that can endure, and a soul that can grow. But I will not take you without your consent. This choice must be yours.”

Ethan hesitated, the weight of her words sinking in. His life flashed before him—the emptiness, the pain, the relentless cycle of hopelessness. And then, the warmth of her presence, the possibility of something greater.

“I... I’ll do it,” he said, his voice trembling but firm. “I’ll go.”

Merithera smiled, placing a hand gently on his shoulder. “Then close your eyes, Ethan. And when you wake again, your new life will begin.”
