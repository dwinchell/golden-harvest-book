### Scene 5: Falling Asleep in Despair

Ethan lay on his bed, staring at the cracked ceiling. The faint glow of the city filtered through his window, the shadows from passing car headlights drifting lazily across the walls. The muffled hum of the world outside only made the stillness of his room feel heavier. It was the kind of silence that wasn’t peaceful—just empty.

He shifted, the thin mattress creaking under his weight. The burrito he’d heated earlier sat untouched on his desk, now cold and forgotten. His stomach grumbled, but he ignored it. Eating felt like too much effort.

Today had been just like every other day. The endless grind of work, the suffocating call from his mom, and the hollow return to this dingy apartment—it all blurred together into a single, oppressive weight pressing down on his chest. He replayed the moments over and over, picking apart what he could’ve done differently, though deep down, he knew it wouldn’t have mattered. Nothing ever changed.

His gaze shifted to the photo on the windowsill. The faded image of his grandparents’ farm caught the faintest hint of light. He remembered standing in those fields as a boy, the golden wheat stretching out like an endless ocean. The air had been fresh, alive. He’d felt alive back then, too. 

Now, he felt like a ghost, moving through a life that didn’t belong to him.

Ethan let out a shaky breath and closed his eyes, but the silence only gave his thoughts more room to wander. His mother’s voice echoed in his mind, sharp and relentless. “You owe us.” “What do you even spend your money on?” “You’re not married, you don’t have kids…” Each word cut deeper, leaving behind a dull ache that refused to fade.

He rolled onto his side, curling into himself. The image of his boss came next, glaring down at him with that smug look of superiority. “Why are you even here?” he’d said. Good question, Ethan thought bitterly.

A tear slipped down his cheek before he could stop it. He wiped it away quickly, as if someone might see. It wasn’t like crying would solve anything. Nothing would. He was stuck in this life—this endless loop of disappointment and failure—and there was no way out.

*Unless…*

The thought was faint, more a whisper than a fully formed idea. What if there was a way out? What if something—anything—changed?

Ethan’s chest tightened as he opened his eyes, staring at the faint light on the ceiling. *I just want it to stop,* he thought. *I want something else. Something better. Please... anything.*

The words hung in the stillness, unanswered, but he didn’t have the energy to dwell on them. Exhaustion crept in, pulling him under. His mind wandered as he drifted into sleep, fragmented images flashing behind his closed eyes: his mother’s voice, the cold stare of his boss, the empty streets outside his apartment. 

And then, something softer. The fields of wheat, swaying gently in the breeze. His grandmother’s laughter. The warmth of the sun on his skin.

The images blurred together, fading into the darkness of sleep. For the first time in years, Ethan’s final thought wasn’t one of anger or regret. It was a simple, silent plea: *Please, let this end.*

The room fell silent. Outside, the city hummed on, indifferent to the broken man lying in its shadow.
