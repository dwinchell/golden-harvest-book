### Scene 1: Ethan’s Struggles at Work

The flickering fluorescent lights buzzed overhead, casting a harsh, pale glow across the cramped office. Rows of desks filled the open space, each stacked with clutter—coffee-stained papers, tangled cables, and monitors that seemed one error message away from breaking down entirely. Ethan sat at the farthest desk, his chair squeaking faintly as he leaned forward, staring at the spreadsheet on his screen.

His eyes scanned the rows of numbers, catching yet another mistake he hadn’t noticed before. He sighed, the tension in his chest tightening with every passing second. Fixing the error would only take a moment, but he knew the real challenge lay ahead. Submitting the report meant facing Mr. Grayson.

As if on cue, the sound of shoes clicking sharply against the tile floor broke through the muffled typing and quiet chatter around him. Ethan glanced up just as Grayson, the office manager, stepped out of his glass-walled office, a stack of papers in hand and a frown etched deep into his face.

“Ethan!” Grayson’s voice carried easily across the room, slicing through the ambient noise like a blade.

Ethan froze. Every head in the office turned toward him.

“Yes, sir?” he said, forcing himself to meet the man’s gaze.

Grayson held up a report, shaking it slightly for emphasis. “Care to explain why this is incomplete? The client is expecting this tonight, and you’ve wasted hours fumbling around with it.”

Heat rose to Ethan’s face. “I—I found an error,” he stammered. “I’m fixing it now. It’ll be ready in five minutes.”

“Five minutes too late,” Grayson snapped, stepping closer. His eyes narrowed as he looked down at Ethan’s desk, as if the clutter there confirmed his every suspicion. “This isn’t amateur hour, Ethan. Do you know how many people would kill for this job? People who wouldn’t waste my time or the company’s?”

“I’m sorry,” Ethan muttered, keeping his voice low.

“Sorry doesn’t cut it,” Grayson said, his tone sharper now. “I don’t have time to clean up after you. If you can’t handle this, maybe you’re in the wrong place.”

Satisfied with the dressing down, Grayson spun on his heel and strode back to his office. Ethan stared at his screen, his hands trembling slightly as he tried to focus on the corrections. Around him, the muted sounds of typing resumed, but he could still feel the weight of his coworkers’ stares.

Across the room, a burst of laughter broke the tense silence. Two coworkers, Jen and Matt, leaned against a desk, talking animatedly.

“So, we’re all set for Saturday?” Jen asked, grinning. “Clyde’s at seven. Trivia night.”

“Absolutely,” Matt replied. “You better bring your A-game this time.”

“Ha, you wish. I’m taking you down.”

Ethan listened without meaning to. Their voices were warm, friendly, so completely separate from the coldness that surrounded his own desk. He’d never been invited to join them. It wasn’t that they were cruel—they probably didn’t even think about him at all.

He finished the report and sent it off, attaching it to a brief email with the subject line, “Corrected File.” No need for pleasantries; Grayson wouldn’t read them anyway.

As he stood to grab his coat, he glanced toward Grayson’s office. The manager stood by his desk now, chatting with a favored employee, his face lit up with a rare smile. He clapped the man on the shoulder, a clear sign of approval.

Ethan turned away, the tightness in his chest growing heavier. The entire office revolved around Grayson’s moods—his whims and favoritism dictating who thrived and who endured. There was no fairness, no balance. Only power.

On his way out, Ethan passed Jen and Matt, who barely noticed him. Their laughter followed him to the elevator, each chuckle a reminder of his place in the world.

Out on the street, the cold air bit at his cheeks as he pulled his coat tighter around himself. The city stretched around him, towering buildings and busy streets alive with light and sound. He tilted his head back, staring up at the skyscrapers. Their reflective surfaces caught the neon glow of signs and traffic lights, but to Ethan, they looked empty—soulless monuments to the same imbalance he faced at work.

*There has to be more than this,* he thought, the words lingering like a quiet prayer. But the city gave no answer, its hum continuing as if he wasn’t even there.
