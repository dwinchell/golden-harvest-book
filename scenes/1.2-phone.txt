### Scene 2: A Toxic Phone Call

Ethan walked down the cracked sidewalk, the night air cold and heavy. The city around him buzzed with muted life—cars honking in the distance, snippets of laughter from a nearby alley, and the faint hum of a neon sign blinking erratically above a corner store. His breath formed small clouds as he pulled his coat tighter around himself. He didn’t mind the cold; it distracted him from the warmth of shame still burning in his chest after the incident at work.

He glanced at his phone as it vibrated in his pocket. The screen lit up with a name he wished he could ignore: **Mom**. Below her name was an old photo, a forced smile from a woman who had mastered the art of looking loving in public.

Ethan stopped walking and stared at the screen, his thumb hovering over the “decline” button. But guilt, familiar and persistent, crept in. He sighed and answered.

“Hi, Mom.”

“Well, it’s about time you picked up,” came her voice, dripping with thinly veiled reproach. “I’ve been trying to call you for days.”

“I’ve been busy,” Ethan said, trying to keep his tone neutral. He resumed walking, his pace slower now, as though the weight of the call was dragging him down.

“Busy? Too busy for your family?” Her words were sharp, but her tone carried a layer of feigned sweetness that made them sting even more. “You know your father and I aren’t getting any younger. We could use some help around here.”

Ethan bit back the first retort that came to mind. “What do you need?”

She sighed theatrically. “It’s just… things are tight right now. Your father’s disability check doesn’t stretch as far as it used to, and the bills are piling up. You know how expensive everything is these days.”

He knew where this was going. He always did. “I just sent you money last month,” he said carefully, already feeling the walls closing in.

“And it barely covered anything!” Her voice sharpened. “Ethan, you know how much we’ve done for you. You wouldn’t even have gotten through college without us. And don’t think I don’t know how much you owe us for that.”

Ethan closed his eyes, his free hand curling into a fist. “I’m barely making ends meet myself, Mom. I can’t just—”

“Don’t start with the excuses,” she cut him off. “You’re working a good job, aren’t you? What do you even spend your money on? You’re not married, you don’t have kids. It’s not like you’ve got anyone else to take care of.”

The words hit harder than she probably realized. “I’m doing what I can,” he said quietly, his voice barely audible over the sound of a passing car.

There was a pause, the kind that always made him feel like he’d said something wrong. Then she sighed again, her disappointment practically oozing through the phone. “Fine. I guess we’ll just have to figure it out on our own. Don’t worry about us. We’ll manage somehow.”

Ethan’s chest tightened, the guilt flooding back in full force. He hated how easily she could twist the knife, how expertly she could make him feel like a selfish failure. “I’ll send what I can,” he muttered.

“Well, thank you,” she said, her tone brightening instantly. “It’s good to know you still care about your family.”

The call ended soon after, her final words a saccharine, “Love you, Ethan,” that left a sour taste in his mouth. He didn’t respond before the line went dead.

Ethan slipped his phone back into his pocket, his steps heavier than before. The cold city felt even more unwelcoming now, its lights harsh and unyielding. He kept walking, not entirely sure where he was going. His apartment was waiting, but so was the suffocating emptiness he’d been trying to avoid all day.

For a moment, he wondered what it would feel like to just keep walking, past his building, past the city, past this life.

But he knew better than to entertain the thought. He was stuck. For now, at least.
