### Scene 4: A Glimpse of Longing

Ethan sat on the edge of his bed, the faint glow of the city lights spilling through the window and painting faint patterns on the walls. The sounds of the night filtered in—distant honking, the occasional rumble of a passing car, and the faint murmur of conversations drifting up from the street below. The neon sign from the corner store blinked erratically, casting a tired pink glow that pulsed like a weak heartbeat.

He leaned forward, resting his elbows on his knees, and stared out at the skyline. The towering buildings stretched upward, their sharp edges and gleaming surfaces mocking him. The city felt alive, a breathing entity made of steel and glass, but it had never cared for him. He was just another unnoticed piece of its machinery.

In the distance, he could see the faint outline of a factory, its chimneys spewing smoke that blurred into the night sky. The stars were hidden, swallowed by the haze of light and pollution. Except for one. A single star flickered weakly near the horizon, its light trembling against the void.

Ethan’s eyes lingered on that star as his thoughts drifted. He had once believed in things like hope and possibility. His grandparents had nurtured that belief on their farm. The memories came unbidden, soft and bittersweet. He could almost hear the rhythmic creak of the old rocking chair on their porch, feel the sun’s warmth on his face as it set over golden fields of wheat.

He remembered the steady hum of the tractor, the smell of freshly tilled soil, and the laughter of his grandmother as she wiped flour-covered hands on her apron. The farm had been more than a place—it had been a sanctuary. A home. He had felt connected there, like he belonged to something larger than himself.

But those days felt impossibly distant now, as if they belonged to someone else’s life. The farm was gone, sold off after his grandparents passed, and with it had gone the only place he’d ever truly felt at peace. The photo on the windowsill caught his eye, the edges worn from years of handling. The red barn, the weathered farmhouse, the fields stretching endlessly—it all seemed so small in the frame, a fragment of a world that no longer existed.

Ethan closed his eyes and let out a slow breath. His chest ached, not just with the weight of what he had lost but with the suffocating realization that he couldn’t see a way forward. Every day felt the same—waking up, trudging through work, returning to this cold, lifeless apartment. He wanted more. Needed more. But no matter how hard he tried to envision it, he couldn’t see a path to something better.

Opening his eyes, he looked at the lone star again. It flickered faintly, its light fighting against the encroaching darkness. For a moment, he let himself imagine that it was a sign, that somewhere out there, something or someone might hear him.

*I wish for something to change,* he thought, the words forming silently in his mind. *Anything. Just… something.*

The star twinkled once more before a cloud swallowed it whole. Ethan sat there, staring at the empty sky for a long time. Eventually, he climbed into bed, pulling the thin blanket over himself. The photo of the farm remained on the windowsill, catching the faint glow of the city lights.

As he drifted into an uneasy sleep, the quiet room seemed to echo with his unspoken plea.
