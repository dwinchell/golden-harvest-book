### Scene 3: Home to an Empty Room

Ethan pushed open the apartment door, the creak of the hinges loud in the otherwise silent hallway. Inside, the familiar mix of stale air and cheap takeout greeted him. The small living room was dim, lit only by the blue flicker of the TV. His roommate, Jared, was sprawled on the sagging couch, a greasy box of pizza perched precariously on his stomach.

“Hey,” Ethan said as he stepped inside, more out of habit than any real expectation of a response.

Jared grunted, his eyes glued to the screen. The volume was up far too loud for the small space, the sounds of gunfire and explosions from the latest action movie rattling the thin walls.

Ethan sighed and slipped off his coat, draping it over the back of a chair. The kitchen, a cramped corner of the open-plan apartment, was as cluttered as ever. Empty soda cans lined the counter, and the sink was filled with dishes that Jared had promised to wash two days ago. Ethan didn’t have the energy to deal with it. Not tonight.

He opened the freezer and pulled out a frozen burrito, the last of the budget meals he’d stocked up on during his last paycheck. A glance at the fridge door reminded him why he was stretching every dollar—unpaid bills were clipped haphazardly to the door, their bright red “FINAL NOTICE” stamps practically glowing in the dim light.

The microwave beeped as he pressed the buttons. The machine whirred to life, the low hum mingling with the cacophony from the TV. Jared didn’t so much as glance in Ethan’s direction, too absorbed in the action on screen to notice the strain on Ethan’s face.

“Good movie?” Ethan asked, trying to make conversation.

“Eh, it’s fine,” Jared mumbled, his mouth half-full of pizza. He didn’t elaborate, his attention already back on the TV.

The microwave beeped again. Ethan pulled out the burrito, its plastic wrapping too hot to touch, and grabbed a fork from the counter. He made his way to his room, the door clicking softly shut behind him.

His sanctuary, if it could be called that, was as sparse as the rest of the apartment. A twin bed with a threadbare blanket sat in one corner, a small desk cluttered with papers and an old laptop in the other. The only decoration was a framed photo of his grandparents’ farm on the windowsill, the colors faded but the memories still sharp.

Ethan sat on the edge of his bed, poking at the burrito with his fork. He wasn’t really hungry, but the routine gave him something to focus on. His eyes drifted to the photo—the rolling fields of golden wheat, the sturdy red barn, the house with its peeling white paint but warm, inviting glow. He could almost smell the fresh-baked bread his grandmother used to make, the earthy scent of hay from the barn.

But the memories felt more like a cruel taunt than a comfort. That life was long gone, and the connection he’d felt back then seemed impossibly far away.

He set the burrito on his desk, untouched, and picked up his phone. He scrolled through endless social media feeds, but the photos of smiling friends and perfect vacations only deepened the ache in his chest. After a few minutes, he tossed the phone aside and leaned back on his bed, staring at the cracked ceiling.

The sound of Jared’s TV seeped through the thin walls, a constant reminder of how empty his life felt. Ethan closed his eyes and let out a long, shaky breath. For the thousandth time, he wished for something to change, for some way out of the crushing monotony and hopelessness.

But as always, the only answer was the silence of his room and the weight of another night to endure.
