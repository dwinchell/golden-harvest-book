#### **Section 1.2: The Summoning**

Ethan’s eyes fluttered open, the quiet hum of the city outside his window the only sound in the stillness of his room. He had been tossing and turning, his thoughts tangled in the web of his frustrations, when he noticed it—the faintest of vibrations in the floor beneath him. He sat up slowly, listening closely, but the sound had already faded. His room was still, as it always was, save for the low glow of his bedside lamp.

A sudden flicker of the light caught his attention. It wasn’t a bulb going out or a power surge—this felt different. The light blinked again, and then, without warning, the air around him seemed to hum with energy. Ethan’s breath caught in his throat. His pulse quickened, and he felt a strange tightness in his chest, like the world was holding its breath.

His heart began to race. Something was wrong—something *was* happening. He glanced around the room, trying to make sense of it, but everything remained as it should be. Except, that was when he saw it.

At first, it was just a glimmer, a faint shimmer in the air, too distant to touch. But then the shimmer grew brighter, coalescing into a shimmering golden light that formed a swirling vortex before him. Ethan froze, his mind scrambling for an explanation, but none came. The portal was undeniable—a massive, glowing circle filled with intricate runes that twisted and turned in the air, each one pulsing with strange energy. The light itself seemed to radiate from the very center of the portal, casting an otherworldly glow that painted his walls in hues of gold and amber.

His breath hitched. This wasn’t real. It couldn’t be. He stepped back instinctively, eyes wide with shock and fear. "No," he whispered to himself, his heart hammering in his chest. "This isn’t real."

But the portal only pulsed stronger, a rhythmic pull emanating from it like a magnetic force, drawing him in. Ethan’s feet moved as if on their own accord, and he staggered back, trying to resist the invisible force. He reached out instinctively for something—anything—to hold on to, but the air itself seemed to resist him, pressing down, making it harder to stay in place.

"What the hell is happening?" His voice was barely a whisper, drowned out by the pulse of energy that was growing louder, closer. The room felt smaller, the walls bending inward, suffocating him with the weight of this impossible event.

The pull grew stronger, his body trembling as the invisible force yanked him toward the glowing circle. Ethan tried to push against it, desperate to escape, but his limbs felt heavy, uncooperative. His mind screamed at him to run, to get away from whatever this was, but it was as though his body didn’t belong to him anymore. It was as if something far more powerful was in control now.

"No, please," Ethan gasped, trying to resist with every ounce of his strength, but his feet were no longer his own. He stumbled forward, unable to stop, his arms flailing in an instinctual attempt to break free. 

The swirling vortex was inches from him now, and Ethan could see it more clearly—how the runes writhed, each one etched with purpose, glowing brightly as though they were calling to him, beckoning him closer. The light enveloped him, pulling him in with an intensity he could no longer fight. His body twisted as the energy swept through him, dragging him into the center of the vortex.

His vision blurred as the world around him dissolved. The walls of his room, the hum of the city outside, even his own thoughts seemed to fade, replaced by a rushing torrent of sensation and color. The air grew thick and oppressive, his mind screaming for clarity, but everything was slipping through his grasp. He couldn’t breathe. He couldn’t think. The light surrounded him, disorienting him until all that remained was the feeling of falling, tumbling, spiraling into the unknown.

Ethan’s vision went dark, his last thoughts lost in the chaos of the transition. The world he had known was gone, consumed by the vortex, and as his senses slipped away, he could only feel the weight of unconsciousness closing in on him.

And then, nothing.
