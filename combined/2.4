#### **2.4: Growing Tension and Realization**

The chill of the evening air pressed in around the village as Ethan followed Lyssara through the streets, the sound of hurried footsteps and clanging weapons echoing from the militia preparing for the oncoming threat. The quiet murmur of the villagers preparing for the Decay beasts was punctuated by the occasional shout, and the sense of urgency was palpable. Even though the village had a semblance of order, the tension hung thick like a cloud. 

Ethan felt the weight of the world bearing down on him as they reached the village’s outer barricades. The sight of the guards nervously adjusting their weapons, their eyes darting to the forest’s edge, made his heart race. He was far from ready to face whatever creatures lurked out there.

*What am I doing here?* Ethan thought, his stomach tight. *I’m not equipped for this. I’m not ready.* His hands gripped the sword Lyssara had given him, the unfamiliar weight making his palms sweat. He thought of his old life—his job, his tiny apartment, the mundane routine that had once felt like a cage but now seemed like the only thing he could understand. *I wasn’t cut out for this. I’m not a warrior. I’m not a hero.*

He glanced at Lyssara, who was speaking to the militia, issuing orders with sharp precision. She moved with the confidence of someone who had faced this countless times before. *She’s been through this. She knows what she’s doing,* Ethan thought, feeling a sharp pang of self-doubt. How could he possibly measure up? How could he, with his empty character sheet and untested skills, help defend the village from beasts of decay?

“Ethan,” Lyssara’s voice cut through his spiraling thoughts. He turned to see her looking at him with a stern, but not unkind, expression. “I can see it in your face. You’re thinking about running.”

Ethan opened his mouth, but the words didn’t come. He couldn’t admit the truth, not even to himself—he was terrified. Terrified of failing, terrified of the unknown.

Lyssara took a step toward him, her eyes unwavering. “It’s normal to feel afraid. You’re not supposed to be comfortable with this. Nobody is when they start. But you need to understand something.” She placed a firm hand on his shoulder, looking him in the eyes. “Survival here isn’t about being the strongest. It’s about being adaptable. Knowing when to fight, when to run, and when to rely on your instincts. The System can only guide you so far. The rest comes from within.”

Ethan nodded slowly, though his mind was still a whirlwind of doubts. He wanted to ask her how she could be so certain, but her gaze softened, as if she could read his thoughts. “I’ve had my fair share of doubts too, Ethan,” she said, her voice low. “I didn’t start out as the confident warrior you see now. I was like you once—new to all this. But I learned. I had no choice but to.”

Lyssara’s words hung in the air as she stepped back, unsheathing her sword with practiced ease. “I didn’t become a warrior because I was born to it. I became one because I had to survive. I learned how to fight, how to think on my feet, how to trust myself in the heat of battle. And most of all, I learned that survival isn’t just about strength or skill—it’s about being able to take the hits and keep moving forward.”

Ethan watched as she demonstrated a series of basic stances, her movements fluid and precise. He was amazed by how effortlessly she handled her weapon. Then, she turned back to him. “You need to stop thinking of yourself as weak. You’re stronger than you think, Ethan. But you won’t know it until you stop doubting yourself.”

Her words lingered as Ethan glanced down at the sword in his hands, the weight of it suddenly feeling a little less foreign. He still wasn’t sure he could ever become like her, but part of him wanted to try. Part of him wanted to be strong enough to stand with the villagers, to face whatever was out there in the wilderness, and not back down.

Lyssara’s voice brought him back to the present. “We’ll start small. You don’t need to be perfect, but you need to keep moving forward. Just focus on the basics for now.”

She walked him through several basic stances again, correcting his posture as she went. The first few attempts felt clumsy, his hands unsure of their place on the sword’s hilt, his feet shifting nervously. But with every correction, he began to feel more in control. The more he focused on the movements, the more the doubts in his head quieted. His grip steadied, and his stance became firmer, more confident.

Ethan didn’t become a fighter in that moment, but something began to change. The fear that had been choking him started to loosen its grip. He wasn’t ready to face the Decay beasts yet—not by a long shot—but he understood that he could take the first steps toward being ready. 

When Lyssara finally called a halt to the training, she gave him a measured nod. “Good. You’re starting to get the hang of it. You’re not a warrior yet, but you’re learning.”

Ethan’s chest rose and fell with a mixture of exhaustion and pride. He wasn’t sure what was waiting for him out in the dark, but for the first time since being summoned to Eryne, he felt like maybe, just maybe, he could survive.
