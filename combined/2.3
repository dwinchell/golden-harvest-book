#### **2.3: The Ever-Present Threat of Decay Beasts**

The sound of hurried footsteps broke the quiet hum of the inn, followed by a soft knock at the door. Lyssara’s gaze flickered toward the entrance, her expression hardening. Without a word, she rose from her seat and crossed the room, opening the door to reveal a young man, breathless and wide-eyed with urgency.

“Lyssara,” the young man gasped, “we’ve spotted Decay beasts near the southern border of the village. A small pack, but they’re moving fast.”

Lyssara’s face tightened as she absorbed the news. “Decay beasts again?” she muttered under her breath, before addressing the young man. “Gather the militia. Get them ready. I’ll meet you there.”

As the man nodded and hurried off, Lyssara turned to Ethan, her face grim. “Decay beasts are a constant threat,” she explained, her voice steady but laced with a seriousness that brooked no delay. “They’re corrupted creatures—beasts born from the dark forces of decay. They infect the land, devouring everything in their path. If they’re not stopped, they spread their blight, consuming villages and turning the earth barren.”

Ethan’s stomach churned at the thought. “So they’re like... monsters? But worse?”

Lyssara gave him a brief nod. “Monsters that are part of a greater corruption. They’re relentless, and their attacks are not uncommon. This isn’t the first time we’ve dealt with them, but it’s always a threat. We have to remain vigilant.”

The atmosphere in the inn shifted as news of the beasts spread. Villagers gathered their families, securing their homes and preparing for what was to come. The sound of boots marching and weapons clanging grew louder as the local militia began to mobilize, an organized calm settling over them despite the urgency.

Ethan watched as the village sprang into action, his eyes wide as he observed the people around him. These weren’t just farmers and traders—these were people who had honed the skill of survival in a world where danger was ever-present. They moved with purpose, readying their weapons, reinforcing the walls, and setting up barricades. Even the elderly and children seemed to understand their roles in maintaining the village’s defenses, offering assistance where they could.

“They’re prepared,” Ethan said quietly, more to himself than to Lyssara.

Lyssara glanced at him, nodding. “They have to be. Every day here is a challenge, and they know that. They’re hardy. Capable. The people here are always on guard because they understand that safety is never guaranteed.”

She turned toward the corner where her own weapons were stored—her sword, gleaming in the firelight, and a sturdy shield, both worn from years of use but well-maintained. She took a deep breath, tightening her grip on the hilt. “The Decay beasts won’t stop coming unless we stop them. It’s up to us to hold the line.”

Lyssara turned to face Ethan. “You need to prepare yourself too. You’ll be helping defend the village, whether you’re ready or not.” 

Ethan felt a surge of uncertainty in his chest. He had no training, no experience with anything like this. How could he help? But before he could voice his hesitation, Lyssara was already moving toward him, pulling a short practice sword from the wall and handing it to him.

“Here,” she said. “We’ll start with the basics. You need to know how to defend yourself at the very least.” She stepped back, her gaze unwavering. “Keep your stance wide. Feet shoulder-width apart. Hold the blade firmly, but don’t overgrip it. You need control, not brute strength.”

Ethan hesitated for a moment before taking the sword. It felt strange in his hands—awkward and foreign. He lifted it, trying to mimic Lyssara’s stance. She watched him for a moment, then moved in with a swift motion, tapping the tip of her sword against his.

“Good,” she said, but her eyes held a note of concern. “You’re untrained, but we don’t have time for hesitation. You have to react, Ethan. When you’re facing danger, hesitation can cost you your life.”

He nodded, trying to focus on her words, but the reality of the situation was beginning to hit him. He had no idea what he was doing, and yet, in a world like this, he had no choice but to try.

Lyssara stepped back, assessing him with a critical eye. “I’ll teach you what I can in the short time we have. The rest will come with experience. But remember, survival here is as much about your will as it is your skill. You need to be ready to fight if it comes to that.”

Ethan swallowed, gripping the sword tighter, determination flickering in his chest. He wasn’t ready for this, not by any means—but the village needed him, and he couldn’t just stand by. 

As Lyssara led him toward the village’s defenses, Ethan’s thoughts were a mix of fear and resolve. The Decay beasts were a terrifying force, but for the first time since his arrival in Eryne, he began to understand that survival here would demand more than just physical strength—it would demand everything he had.
