#### **2.5: The Calm Before the Storm**

Nightfall settled over Haven’s Reach like a heavy blanket, shrouding the village in an eerie stillness. The vibrant sounds of the day had long since quieted, replaced by the distant murmur of people preparing for what they knew was coming. In the fading light of the evening, the village seemed almost peaceful—too peaceful, given the looming threat.

Villagers moved with practiced efficiency, locking doors, securing windows, and reinforcing the walls with every available resource. The air was thick with tension, and the usual comfort of the evening routine felt unnervingly hollow. A few families lingered outside for a moment longer, exchanging quiet words before retreating into their homes. The children, eyes wide with fear, clung to their mothers, who whispered reassuring words that sounded hollow even to Ethan’s ears.

Lyssara walked beside him, her pace measured, but Ethan could feel the tension in her every step. Her expression was calm, yet there was an undercurrent of something darker, something more urgent.

“This is how it always goes,” she said, breaking the silence between them. “The village prepares, knowing that the Decay beasts could strike at any time. But this—this isn’t the worst we face.”

Ethan turned to her, confusion lining his features. “What do you mean? The Decay beasts... they’re dangerous, right? Shouldn’t we be focused on them?”

Lyssara’s gaze hardened as she glanced at the militia preparing at the gates, their faces set with grim determination. “Decay beasts are just symptoms of a much larger problem. They’re nothing compared to the real threat—the conflict between the gods.”

Ethan’s heart skipped. “The gods?”

Lyssara nodded, her eyes narrowing. “The Decay beasts are part of it. They’re manifestations of the corruption spreading from Arceon’s influence, but the true danger lies in the war between the gods themselves. The Covenant and the Zenith—they’re locked in a battle for control, and their struggle could tear apart the very fabric of this world.”

The weight of her words settled heavily on Ethan’s shoulders. He had heard of gods, of factions, of divine influence, but hearing it from Lyssara made it all feel far more real—and far more dangerous.

Ethan’s voice was barely a whisper. “So... I’m part of this? My being here... it’s tied to this war?”

Lyssara’s eyes met his, her expression unreadable for a long moment. “Yes. You’re not just here by chance, Ethan. The gods don’t summon people to this world without purpose. The conflict between them is reaching its peak. The Decay beasts are just the beginning. The real battle will be fought through those like you—those who have been summoned. And you’ll have to choose which side you’re on, sooner or later.”

Ethan stood frozen in place for a moment, the enormity of what she was saying sinking in. His entire existence in Eryne, his reason for being here—he had no idea that it was tied to something so much bigger than he could have ever imagined. His presence wasn’t just a twist of fate—it was a part of a war between gods, and it was a war that could change everything.

The night deepened, and the village seemed to hold its breath, every person on high alert. The air grew colder, the shadows darker, and Ethan felt that familiar unease creep back into his chest. This place, this world—it wasn’t just unfamiliar. It was dangerous. And it wasn’t going to let him leave easily.

Suddenly, from the corner of his eye, Ethan noticed a shadow at the edge of the village, moving quickly and with purpose. It was hard to make out the shape in the dark, but there was something unmistakably menacing about it. His heart skipped as the figure seemed to melt into the surrounding darkness, barely visible in the moonlight.

Lyssara stiffened beside him, her eyes narrowing as she followed his gaze. “Get ready,” she murmured. “The Decay beasts are close.”

The shadow moved again, this time closer, its shape more defined in the dim light. It wasn’t human. It wasn’t even animal. It was something worse, something that made the hairs on the back of Ethan’s neck stand on end.

He could feel his pulse racing as the weight of the moment pressed in. The villagers were readying themselves, positioning weapons and looking to Lyssara for guidance. But Ethan couldn’t shake the feeling that this was only the beginning. What they faced tonight was nothing compared to what was coming.

Lyssara turned to him, her face set with grim determination. “Stay close. Stay alert.”

As she moved toward the militia, Ethan’s breath hitched. The figure at the edge of the village moved again, slipping into the shadows. He wasn’t sure if it was the Decay beasts—or something far worse—but the threat was undeniable. And the storm was coming.

For the first time since his arrival in Eryne, Ethan realized the depth of the danger surrounding him. This world was far more dangerous than he had ever imagined, and the battle wasn’t just for survival—it was for the very soul of Eryne itself.
