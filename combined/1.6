#### **Section 1.6: Path to Haven's Reach**

The forest path stretched out before them, narrow and winding, with towering trees and thick underbrush. Lyssara walked ahead with purpose, her steps steady and confident. Ethan, still trying to come to terms with his situation, trailed behind, his mind racing as the reality of being in Eryne began to sink in. Every rustle in the leaves, every snap of a twig underfoot, made him jump, his nerves frayed. This world was nothing like his own, and the more he thought about it, the less he understood.

“Stay close,” Lyssara’s voice rang out over her shoulder, sharp and clear.

Ethan quickened his pace, trying to match her stride. His thoughts were still swirling, and he couldn’t shake the feeling that something was wrong. *This can’t be real. It just can’t.*

“You look lost,” Lyssara said, glancing back at him with a look that was part amusement, part assessment. “You’re wondering if this is a game, aren’t you?”

Ethan froze for a moment, his heart skipping a beat. He hadn’t said anything out loud, but somehow she knew. His confusion must’ve been obvious on his face. “I—” He swallowed, hesitating. “I mean... it just feels like something out of a game. The System, the levels, the way it all works...”

Lyssara’s gaze softened slightly, but there was still that quiet authority in her voice. “You’re not the first to have doubts. I’ve read about others like you—people summoned to Eryne. They thought the same thing, at first. Wondered if it was all some kind of elaborate illusion or a game.”

Ethan blinked, his confusion deepening. “But—how do you know? How can you be sure it’s real?”

She stopped walking and turned to face him fully, her expression steady. “I’ve read of similar concerns in the accounts of those who were summoned before you. It’s rare, but it happens. People brought here by the gods, uncertain of their purpose. They question the reality of it all, just like you are. But trust me, Ethan—this world is as real as your old one. The System, the creatures, the gods—they’re all real. And you have no choice but to accept that if you want to survive.”

Ethan took a slow breath, trying to absorb her words. The weight of her certainty was hard to ignore. The world around him *felt* real—the air, the ground beneath his feet, the way everything seemed to vibrate with life. And yet, the idea of being summoned, of being chosen by gods, seemed too far-fetched to grasp fully. *Could it be?*

Lyssara’s eyes softened as she continued. “You’re not just here to exist. You’re part of something larger. The System tracks your abilities, your growth, your potential. And the gods—Merithera, Arceon, the others—they have their reasons for bringing you here. But it’s not a game. There are no ‘save points,’ no second chances. Everything you do here matters. Your choices, your actions—they shape what happens next.”

Ethan’s mind raced, trying to piece together the fragments of what Lyssara had said. The reality of it all was slowly beginning to hit him, like a cold wave washing over him. He wasn’t sure if he was ready for this, but he knew he had no choice. *This was real. And he was part of it.*

Lyssara began walking again, her pace unhurried, but her every movement filled with purpose. “You’ll see. In time, you’ll understand. For now, focus on staying alive. This world doesn’t care about your doubts. It only cares about whether you can handle what’s coming.”

As they continued down the path toward Haven’s Reach, the village slowly coming into view in the distance, Ethan felt the weight of his new reality settling around him. It was no longer a question of whether this world was real—it was real. And somehow, he had to navigate it.

The forest around them grew quieter as the village loomed closer. Ethan couldn’t help but feel that the calm was temporary, that the real challenges had only just begun. But at least for now, he wasn’t alone. Lyssara’s presence, though stern, felt like a lifeline in this strange new world.

And as they approached the village, he began to realize that, whether he was ready or not, his journey in Eryne had truly begun.
