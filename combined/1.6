#### **Section 1.6: Path to Haven's Reach**

The forest path stretched ahead, narrow and winding, its edges thick with tangled undergrowth. Lyssara moved with purpose, her boots crunching softly on the earth, each step confident and assured. Her eyes scanned the surrounding woods constantly, her posture relaxed but alert. Ethan trailed behind, his pace hesitant, every crack of a twig underfoot making him jump. He had no idea what to expect next, and the unfamiliar forest, with its strange glowing trees and distant sounds, only added to his unease.

“Stay close,” Lyssara called back without turning, her voice sharp and clear.

Ethan quickened his step, keeping pace with her, but his thoughts were still racing. *What is this place? What am I doing here?* The world felt entirely different from the one he had left behind. The creatures, the dangers, the sense of something bigger looming—it was all overwhelming. He wanted to ask questions, but every time he opened his mouth, the words seemed to disappear before he could say them.

Lyssara glanced over her shoulder as they walked. “You look like you’ve never seen anything like this before. Can’t say I blame you.” Her tone was casual, but there was an edge to it, a clarity that made Ethan feel both more lost and slightly comforted at the same time. “Eryne is a harsh place. And I don’t mean just the wildlife. There’s a lot at play here that you won’t understand yet.”

Ethan hesitated before speaking. “Eryne... The gods summoned me here. But why? What am I supposed to do?”

Lyssara’s lips tightened briefly, but she didn’t break her stride. “You’ll figure that out soon enough. Maybe the gods have their reasons. But right now, what you need to know is that the System governs everything here. It tracks your progress, your stats, your abilities... everything. If you want to survive, you need to pay attention to it. It’s the key to understanding your place in all this.”

Ethan frowned, still not grasping the full picture. “The System?”

Lyssara nodded, her voice softer now but still firm. “It’s like a... framework for the world. You won’t see it all at once, but it’s there, and it’s real. It’s how people level up, how they gain power, how they’re chosen. For you, it’ll be the difference between life and death.” She paused, glancing at him, as if reading his confused expression. “You’re not just here for sightseeing. You’re part of something bigger. The sooner you understand that, the better.”

Ethan’s head was spinning. *Level up? Chosen?* But he couldn’t find the words to question her further. Everything she said felt like a piece of a puzzle that he couldn’t quite put together. He didn’t know how to respond, so he fell silent, focusing on the steady crunch of leaves underfoot and the rustle of leaves as they made their way deeper into the forest.

Despite the unease gnawing at him, he couldn’t help but feel a strange sense of safety in Lyssara’s presence. Her confidence was like a shield around him, and for all his confusion, he found himself trusting her. She was leading him through this unfamiliar world with a steady hand, even if he didn’t understand everything yet.

The path ahead opened into a clearing, and in the distance, Ethan finally saw it—a cluster of buildings, nestled at the edge of a wide river. The village was small but welcoming, with lights glowing from within the windows of cottages and the sound of voices carried on the wind. It looked peaceful, almost serene, but Ethan knew better than to let his guard down.

“There it is,” Lyssara said, her voice softer now. “Haven’s Reach. It’s not much, but it’s safe. For now.”

Ethan’s heart thudded in his chest as the village grew closer. This was his first glimpse of a world that wasn’t the one he had known. It was a world full of unknowns, danger, and power—if he could only learn to navigate it.

As they drew nearer to the village, Lyssara led the way, and Ethan followed, the unknown stretching ahead, but with each step, a part of him began to settle. The path wasn’t clear yet, but it was a start.
