#### **Section 1.4: The First Encounter**

The creature’s red eyes gleamed as it took another step forward, its enormous frame moving with unnatural grace for something so large. Ethan’s heart thundered in his chest as terror gripped him, his instincts screaming at him to run. He stumbled backward, his legs weak and uncooperative, his mind locked in a spiral of panic. *Why can’t I move?* 

The creature’s breath was a low, rumbling growl, and its lips curled back to reveal rows of jagged, yellow teeth. It let out a sickening screech, a sound that vibrated through the very air, and suddenly, it lunged. 

Ethan’s legs gave out from under him. He collapsed backward, his hands scraping against the rough forest floor as he tried in vain to push himself away. His breath came in ragged gasps, and his thoughts were a chaotic jumble of fear and confusion. *This is it. I’m going to die here.*

The Decay beast was upon him in an instant, its claws slashing through the air with deadly precision. Ethan could see the sickly green light flickering in its eyes as it bore down on him, its grotesque form blocking out the dim light of the forest.

He flailed, trying to get his hands on anything to defend himself, but everything felt too slow, too distant. The beast’s mouth opened wide, revealing sharp teeth that dripped with a viscous, black substance. It was ready to strike.

Just as its claws neared his chest, Ethan squeezed his eyes shut, bracing for impact. *This is it. I’m done.*

But then, the beast froze.

A sharp, high-pitched sound rang through the air, followed by a powerful crash. The ground beneath Ethan’s hands shook, and the Decay beast howled in pain, its green eyes wide with sudden confusion. A flash of steel gleamed in the dim light as something moved too quickly for Ethan to process—another blur, this one purposeful, precise, and deadly.

The creature screeched again, this time in agony, as a sword plunged deep into its side, the blade glowing with an ethereal light. The beast’s body jerked violently, its monstrous form faltering as the sword cut through the corrupted flesh with ease. A second, quicker blow followed, and the creature collapsed, its body shuddering before it crumpled to the forest floor, lifeless.

Ethan stared up in disbelief, his chest heaving as he tried to make sense of what had just happened. The forest fell into a tense silence, the eerie stillness broken only by his ragged breaths. He could barely move, the adrenaline still surging through his veins, his body shaking uncontrollably.

From the shadows, a figure emerged, tall and confident, silhouetted by the faint glow of the forest around them. The sword gleamed in their hand, dripping with the creature’s dark, corrupted blood.

The figure stepped into the light, and Ethan’s wide eyes locked onto the warrior who had just saved him.
