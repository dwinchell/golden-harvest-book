Yes, a single event can absolutely be spread across multiple scenes, and this technique is often used to:

Build tension by breaking an event into smaller, suspenseful moments.
Show different perspectives or aspects of the event.
Pace the story effectively, alternating between fast and slow moments.
Deepen emotional or thematic impact by exploring the event's consequences or context.
How to Spread an Event Across Multiple Scenes
Divide the Event into Logical Parts:

Break the event into smaller, natural components, each with its own focus.
Example: A battle might include:
Scene 1: Preparing for the battle.
Scene 2: The opening clash.
Scene 3: The turning point and resolution.
Introduce Multiple Perspectives:

Show the event from the viewpoints of different characters or groups.
Example: During a village defense, one scene could follow Ethan on the front lines, while another shows Lyssara strategizing with the villagers.
Interweave Subplots:

Use breaks between scenes to address other story threads, creating a layered narrative.
Example: The event of a Decay beast attack might pause to show Veyara’s perspective as she orchestrates the attack.
Vary Emotional Beats:

Use separate scenes to explore different emotions or stakes tied to the event.
Example: In a confrontation, one scene might focus on action, while another explores Ethan’s fear and resolve afterward.

Benefits of Spreading an Event Across Multiple Scenes
Enhanced Pacing:

Alternating fast and slow scenes keeps the reader engaged and prevents fatigue.
Deeper Exploration:

Allows you to delve into different aspects of the event, such as strategy, emotions, or consequences.
Increased Stakes:

Prolonging the event can heighten tension and suspense, especially if each scene ends on a mini-cliffhanger.
Rich Worldbuilding:

Separate scenes provide opportunities to integrate setting, culture, or System mechanics without overwhelming the reader.
In Harvester’s Path:
A single event like the Decay beast attack on Haven’s Reach could span multiple scenes:

Scene 1: The villagers prepare for the attack, with Ethan grappling with his fear.
Scene 2: The Decay beasts break through, highlighting Lyssara’s leadership and Ethan’s initial hesitation.
Scene 3: Ethan takes decisive action, helping turn the tide.
Scene 4: In the aftermath, Lyssara reflects on Ethan’s potential, setting up future growth.
