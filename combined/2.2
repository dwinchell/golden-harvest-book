#### **2.2: Understanding Eryne's Mechanics**

The warmth of the Haven’s Reach inn provided a welcome contrast to the chill that lingered in Ethan’s bones. The flickering firelight cast long shadows across the room, but all he could focus on was the overwhelming weight of the world around him. Lyssara sat across from him, her demeanor calm, though there was a seriousness to her that matched the gravity of their conversation.

“You need to understand how everything works here, Ethan,” Lyssara began, her tone firm. “It’s all about the System.”

Ethan leaned in slightly, the term still foreign to him. “The System?”

Lyssara nodded. “The System is how everything is tracked in this world. It records your progress, your stats, and your abilities. It’s how mortals grow and develop in Eryne.” She paused, her gaze steady. “Everyone has a potential class that develops as they level up, but there’s more to it than that. The gods have their hand in this. The System itself is directly influenced by the gods, and they shape people’s paths in ways you can’t control.”

Ethan frowned, trying to process this new information. “So, the gods... they control everything?”

“Not everything, but they control the blessings they bestow,” Lyssara clarified. “The System tracks your development, but the gods grant power to a select few. These are the ones they choose to bless, to elevate to something more. If you’re chosen, you gain the favor of a god, and that blessing can unlock abilities, powers—things the average mortal can never attain.”

Ethan felt a knot tighten in his stomach. He was still struggling to accept the concept of gods influencing the very course of his life. “And how do I know if I’m one of those chosen ones?”

Lyssara gave him a small, knowing smile. “That’s something you’ll have to prove. Your path will unfold as you engage with the world. If you’re fortunate enough to be blessed, you’ll find yourself becoming more powerful, more capable. But that’s not something that happens instantly—it’s something you’ll work toward.”

Ethan nodded, but still felt a sense of unease. How could he possibly know if he was chosen? It all felt too overwhelming.

Lyssara, sensing his hesitation, offered him a more direct example. “Let me show you how this works. Show me your character sheet.”

Ethan looked at her, confused. “My what?”

Lyssara motioned to the air between them, and with a flick of her hand, a translucent screen materialized in front of him. It glowed softly, displaying a series of numbers and symbols.

“This is your character sheet,” she explained. “It’s how the System tracks your stats, your progress, and potential. Go ahead—show me your stats.”

Ethan stared at the screen, still not entirely sure what to expect. The screen displayed his name at the top: *Ethan*—simple and unremarkable. Underneath, there were a series of categories: *Strength*, *Agility*, *Intelligence*, and others. Each of these categories had a low number next to them, all set to 1.

Beneath those, it read: *Class: None* and *Level: 0*. There were no skills listed—nothing but an empty slate.

He blinked, surprised by how... basic everything seemed. “Is this all I am right now?”

Lyssara nodded. “Yes. Your stats are low because you haven’t done anything yet to influence them. You have no class because, as a Summoned One, your class hasn’t developed yet. You need to experience the world—make choices, face challenges. Your class will develop as you adapt to this new life.”

Ethan looked back at the screen, feeling a strange sense of inadequacy. “So, I’m basically... nothing?”

Lyssara’s eyes softened, and she gave a short, understanding laugh. “Not nothing. You’re a Summoned One, and that alone means something. You’ve been chosen for a reason, even if you don’t know what that reason is yet. The System just hasn’t revealed your class. Your journey will shape who you become.”

Ethan felt his chest tighten. It was a lot to take in, and the feeling of being so unprepared for this world only intensified. “So, my class will just... come to me as I get stronger?”

Lyssara’s voice became more serious. “Yes. But it’s also about more than just strength. It’s about what you stand for, what you believe in, and who you align yourself with. That’s where the gods come in. The gods bless individuals who align with their ideals.”

“Merithera and Arceon,” Ethan said, recalling some of what Lyssara had told him earlier.

Lyssara nodded. “Exactly. Merithera, goddess of harvest, protection, and balance. Her followers value harmony and life. The Covenant, her faction, is about growth, nurturing, and the protection of the land. Arceon, on the other hand, leads the Zenith. His followers value power, strength, and domination. They seek to rise above others, to control and conquer.”

Ethan took a slow breath. “And the gods decide who gets to be blessed?”

“Yes,” Lyssara confirmed. “The gods choose who they empower. They look for individuals who reflect their values and ideals. It’s why your connection to Merithera might be significant. You’ve been summoned, and the System may align you with her. But it’s up to you to prove that you’re worthy of her blessing.”

Ethan glanced back at the character sheet, still trying to process everything. It felt like so much had changed in such a short time. The weight of the gods’ influence on his life, the potential for power—everything seemed tied to choices he hadn’t even made yet.

Lyssara continued, her gaze steady. “Don’t rush to understand it all, Ethan. Just know that you’re on a path, and that path will lead you to what you need to do. The System will help guide you, but your connection to a god could shape everything. The question is: will you prove yourself worthy of their favor?”

Ethan looked at the glowing screen, his thoughts heavy with the possibility of what lay ahead. He didn’t have answers, but one thing was becoming clearer: his life in Eryne had just begun, and the choices he made now would shape his future in ways he couldn’t yet comprehend.
