#### **Section 1.5: Lyssara’s Introduction**

Lyssara’s eyes narrowed as she assessed Ethan, still shaken from the ordeal. The Decay beast lay dead at her feet, dispatched with swift precision. Her sword gleamed in the dim light of the forest, and her shield, marked with battle scars, remained steady at her side. She took a step toward Ethan, her gaze unwavering.

“You’re a Summoned One, aren’t you?” she asked, her voice a mix of curiosity and mild exasperation. “You’re lucky I was here.” Her eyes lingered on him, sizing him up as if already deciding what to do next. “You don’t look prepared for what’s ahead. Most aren’t.”

Ethan blinked, the words barely making sense to him. “Summoned One?” he echoed, his voice hoarse. He didn’t understand what she meant, nor how to respond. The weight of everything happening was too much for him to process. His head was still spinning.

Lyssara’s expression softened just a fraction, but there was no mistaking the urgency in her voice. “It’s rare, but it’s known. Scythes are trained to recognize those like you—Summoned Ones. If we find one, we’re supposed to take them in and keep an eye on them. They're often chosen by the gods for something. Whether they’re ready or not.”

She glanced around at the surrounding forest, the tension in the air thick as the sound of distant creatures echoed through the trees. “You were summoned here for a reason, and that reason is likely tied to the gods' plans. But right now, if you want to survive, the first thing you need to do is stay alive. And that means following me.”

Ethan’s heart raced, his mind still struggling to wrap around the gravity of her words. *Summoned by the gods?* He had no idea how to reconcile the normal world he had left behind with the one that now seemed to be unfolding in front of him. The sense of danger was everywhere.

“Where are we going?” he asked, his voice trembling.

“Haven’s Reach,” Lyssara said without missing a beat. “It’s the closest village. We’ll get there and figure things out. But you’ll need to stay close. Keep up, or you won’t last out here.”

Ethan nodded, though he wasn’t sure if he was ready for whatever lay ahead. His gaze shifted back toward the Decay beast’s corpse, still too real, too close. He had no idea what he had just stepped into, but it was clear that the only choice he had was to follow.

Lyssara turned, already heading deeper into the forest, her movements swift and purposeful. Ethan hesitated for a moment, taking a deep breath to steady himself. Then, gathering whatever courage he could find, he followed. The weight of the unknown pressed heavily on his chest, but at least he wasn’t alone. Not completely.

As they left the site of his summoning behind, the eerie stillness of the forest seemed to close in around them.
