#### **Section 1.1: Ethan’s Mundane Life**

Ethan sat hunched over his desk, his eyes scanning the endless rows of numbers on the screen. The fluorescent lights above hummed, casting a dull glow over the sterile office. He clicked through the tabs on his computer, inputting data into forms he knew by heart, his fingers moving automatically. The rhythm of the office—quiet, mechanical—matched the rhythm of his life. Each day felt the same: wake up, go to work, repeat.

The work wasn’t hard, but it wasn’t fulfilling either. His job at the accounting firm barely registered in his mind anymore. It was just something he did to get by, a placeholder in the sequence of his life. He could’ve done it with his eyes closed, and maybe part of him wished he could. The clients and deadlines had blurred into one giant, monotonous mass of mediocrity. He used to think he would have a career that meant something, but that dream felt distant, as if it belonged to a younger version of himself—someone full of hope and ambition, long before the world had worn him down.

Lunchtime came, but the breakroom was as empty as always. Ethan picked at his sandwich, its dry crusts scraping against his teeth. He had never felt more alone in this place, surrounded by people who only ever spoke to him when they needed something. No one to talk to, no one to share his thoughts with. Not that he had anything worth saying. His thoughts were the same every day, a quiet spiral of dissatisfaction and frustration. *What am I doing here?* he asked himself, as he stared at the untouched half of his sandwich. He wondered how long it would take before he simply stopped coming in, before he disappeared into the background, unnoticed.

When the workday finally ended, it felt more like a reprieve than a victory. The weight of the day had dragged on, but there was no real sense of accomplishment. Just a sense of relief that it was over, for now. The bus ride home was equally uninspiring, filled with the same tired faces and the occasional grumble about traffic. No one spoke, their gazes fixed on the floor or their phones, as if the act of existing in the same space required as little interaction as possible.

At home, Kyle was already in front of the TV, controller in hand, fully immersed in whatever game had captured his attention. His loud voice echoed through the apartment as he argued with some online stranger, his laughter shrill and unapologetic. Kyle was Ethan’s roommate—a stark contrast to him in every way. Loud, carefree, and reckless. Kyle didn’t seem to care about the future, didn’t seem to care about anything. His days were spent gaming and ignoring the world outside. Ethan envied him, in a way. At least Kyle had a way of escaping. For Ethan, the escape felt impossible.

“Yo, Ethan, you get the milk?” Kyle’s voice broke through Ethan’s thoughts.

“No, I forgot,” Ethan replied, his own voice sounding distant even to him.

“Cool. Whatever,” Kyle muttered, already returning to his game.

Ethan didn’t mind the casual indifference. He preferred it. It was better than the half-hearted attempts at conversation his parents always made. They didn’t understand him, not really. Their messages—small reminders of his failures—often sat in his inbox, unopened. The pressure to call, to explain why he wasn’t doing more with his life, felt suffocating. He didn’t know how to make them see that he was stuck. They wanted him to climb higher, to be something he couldn’t seem to become.

As the night wore on, Ethan retreated to his room. His apartment, small and cluttered, felt less like a home and more like a temporary place to exist. He lay on his bed, staring at the ceiling, the faint hum of the city outside drifting through the walls. The room was silent, save for the occasional sound of Kyle’s shouting and the distant sirens of the night. Ethan’s thoughts began to swirl again. *I should be doing something more. Anything more.* But the thought felt hollow. He didn’t have the energy to change. The weight of his isolation was too heavy, and the fear of failure too great.

Ethan closed his eyes, trying to shut out the thoughts. Tomorrow would be the same as today, and the day after that, and the day after that. The endless cycle. He pulled the blanket over his shoulders, curling into himself, trying to forget the dull ache of a life that wasn’t quite his own.

And as the darkness of sleep began to pull him under, he couldn’t help but wonder—*Is this really all there is?*
