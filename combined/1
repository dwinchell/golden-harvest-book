#### **Section 1.1: Ethan’s Mundane Life**

Ethan sat hunched over his desk, his eyes scanning the endless rows of numbers on the screen. The fluorescent lights above hummed, casting a dull glow over the sterile office. He clicked through the tabs on his computer, inputting data into forms he knew by heart, his fingers moving automatically. The rhythm of the office—quiet, mechanical—matched the rhythm of his life. Each day felt the same: wake up, go to work, repeat.

The work wasn’t hard, but it wasn’t fulfilling either. His job at the accounting firm barely registered in his mind anymore. It was just something he did to get by, a placeholder in the sequence of his life. He could’ve done it with his eyes closed, and maybe part of him wished he could. The clients and deadlines had blurred into one giant, monotonous mass of mediocrity. He used to think he would have a career that meant something, but that dream felt distant, as if it belonged to a younger version of himself—someone full of hope and ambition, long before the world had worn him down.

Lunchtime came, but the breakroom was as empty as always. Ethan picked at his sandwich, its dry crusts scraping against his teeth. He had never felt more alone in this place, surrounded by people who only ever spoke to him when they needed something. No one to talk to, no one to share his thoughts with. Not that he had anything worth saying. His thoughts were the same every day, a quiet spiral of dissatisfaction and frustration. *What am I doing here?* he asked himself, as he stared at the untouched half of his sandwich. He wondered how long it would take before he simply stopped coming in, before he disappeared into the background, unnoticed.

When the workday finally ended, it felt more like a reprieve than a victory. The weight of the day had dragged on, but there was no real sense of accomplishment. Just a sense of relief that it was over, for now. The bus ride home was equally uninspiring, filled with the same tired faces and the occasional grumble about traffic. No one spoke, their gazes fixed on the floor or their phones, as if the act of existing in the same space required as little interaction as possible.

At home, Kyle was already in front of the TV, controller in hand, fully immersed in whatever game had captured his attention. His loud voice echoed through the apartment as he argued with some online stranger, his laughter shrill and unapologetic. Kyle was Ethan’s roommate—a stark contrast to him in every way. Loud, carefree, and reckless. Kyle didn’t seem to care about the future, didn’t seem to care about anything. His days were spent gaming and ignoring the world outside. Ethan envied him, in a way. At least Kyle had a way of escaping. For Ethan, the escape felt impossible.

“Yo, Ethan, you get the milk?” Kyle’s voice broke through Ethan’s thoughts.

“No, I forgot,” Ethan replied, his own voice sounding distant even to him.

“Cool. Whatever,” Kyle muttered, already returning to his game.

Ethan didn’t mind the casual indifference. He preferred it. It was better than the half-hearted attempts at conversation his parents always made. They didn’t understand him, not really. Their messages—small reminders of his failures—often sat in his inbox, unopened. The pressure to call, to explain why he wasn’t doing more with his life, felt suffocating. He didn’t know how to make them see that he was stuck. They wanted him to climb higher, to be something he couldn’t seem to become.

As the night wore on, Ethan retreated to his room. His apartment, small and cluttered, felt less like a home and more like a temporary place to exist. He lay on his bed, staring at the ceiling, the faint hum of the city outside drifting through the walls. The room was silent, save for the occasional sound of Kyle’s shouting and the distant sirens of the night. Ethan’s thoughts began to swirl again. *I should be doing something more. Anything more.* But the thought felt hollow. He didn’t have the energy to change. The weight of his isolation was too heavy, and the fear of failure too great.

Ethan closed his eyes, trying to shut out the thoughts. Tomorrow would be the same as today, and the day after that, and the day after that. The endless cycle. He pulled the blanket over his shoulders, curling into himself, trying to forget the dull ache of a life that wasn’t quite his own.

And as the darkness of sleep began to pull him under, he couldn’t help but wonder—*Is this really all there is?*
#### **Section 1.2: The Summoning**

Ethan’s eyes fluttered open, the quiet hum of the city outside his window the only sound in the stillness of his room. He had been tossing and turning, his thoughts tangled in the web of his frustrations, when he noticed it—the faintest of vibrations in the floor beneath him. He sat up slowly, listening closely, but the sound had already faded. His room was still, as it always was, save for the low glow of his bedside lamp.

A sudden flicker of the light caught his attention. It wasn’t a bulb going out or a power surge—this felt different. The light blinked again, and then, without warning, the air around him seemed to hum with energy. Ethan’s breath caught in his throat. His pulse quickened, and he felt a strange tightness in his chest, like the world was holding its breath.

His heart began to race. Something was wrong—something *was* happening. He glanced around the room, trying to make sense of it, but everything remained as it should be. Except, that was when he saw it.

At first, it was just a glimmer, a faint shimmer in the air, too distant to touch. But then the shimmer grew brighter, coalescing into a shimmering golden light that formed a swirling vortex before him. Ethan froze, his mind scrambling for an explanation, but none came. The portal was undeniable—a massive, glowing circle filled with intricate runes that twisted and turned in the air, each one pulsing with strange energy. The light itself seemed to radiate from the very center of the portal, casting an otherworldly glow that painted his walls in hues of gold and amber.

His breath hitched. This wasn’t real. It couldn’t be. He stepped back instinctively, eyes wide with shock and fear. "No," he whispered to himself, his heart hammering in his chest. "This isn’t real."

But the portal only pulsed stronger, a rhythmic pull emanating from it like a magnetic force, drawing him in. Ethan’s feet moved as if on their own accord, and he staggered back, trying to resist the invisible force. He reached out instinctively for something—anything—to hold on to, but the air itself seemed to resist him, pressing down, making it harder to stay in place.

"What the hell is happening?" His voice was barely a whisper, drowned out by the pulse of energy that was growing louder, closer. The room felt smaller, the walls bending inward, suffocating him with the weight of this impossible event.

The pull grew stronger, his body trembling as the invisible force yanked him toward the glowing circle. Ethan tried to push against it, desperate to escape, but his limbs felt heavy, uncooperative. His mind screamed at him to run, to get away from whatever this was, but it was as though his body didn’t belong to him anymore. It was as if something far more powerful was in control now.

"No, please," Ethan gasped, trying to resist with every ounce of his strength, but his feet were no longer his own. He stumbled forward, unable to stop, his arms flailing in an instinctual attempt to break free. 

The swirling vortex was inches from him now, and Ethan could see it more clearly—how the runes writhed, each one etched with purpose, glowing brightly as though they were calling to him, beckoning him closer. The light enveloped him, pulling him in with an intensity he could no longer fight. His body twisted as the energy swept through him, dragging him into the center of the vortex.

His vision blurred as the world around him dissolved. The walls of his room, the hum of the city outside, even his own thoughts seemed to fade, replaced by a rushing torrent of sensation and color. The air grew thick and oppressive, his mind screaming for clarity, but everything was slipping through his grasp. He couldn’t breathe. He couldn’t think. The light surrounded him, disorienting him until all that remained was the feeling of falling, tumbling, spiraling into the unknown.

Ethan’s vision went dark, his last thoughts lost in the chaos of the transition. The world he had known was gone, consumed by the vortex, and as his senses slipped away, he could only feel the weight of unconsciousness closing in on him.

And then, nothing.
#### **Section 1.3: Arrival in Eryne**

Ethan’s eyes snapped open, and for a moment, he thought he was still trapped in the swirling vortex. But the air was different now—cool and still, thick with the scent of pine and earth. His mind raced, disoriented as he tried to make sense of his surroundings. He was lying on soft moss, the ground beneath him damp, and as he pushed himself up, he realized the gravity of the situation. 

The world around him was unlike anything he had ever seen.

The trees towered above him, their trunks thick and glowing faintly with an eerie, golden light. Their leaves shimmered, not like ordinary foliage but as though they were bathed in a soft, otherworldly glow. The forest stretched endlessly, the canopy forming an almost unbroken ceiling of light. Everything had an unnatural stillness, as if the forest itself was holding its breath, waiting for something.

Ethan’s heart pounded in his chest as his mind tried to piece together what was happening. Was this some kind of dream? A hallucination? His head spun as he staggered to his feet, but a sudden wave of dizziness made him lean against a nearby tree for support. The bark felt warm against his palm, and he swore he could hear faint whispers within the trunk, like voices trapped in the wood.

Before he could make sense of it, a flash of light cut through his vision—an iridescent, translucent screen that appeared right in front of him. It hovered in midair, glowing with an unnatural brightness as text materialized, slowly forming words.

**[Welcome, Ethan, to Eryne.]**

Ethan blinked, confusion spreading through him like a cold sweat. He took a step back, but the screen stayed with him, suspended in the air. His fingers hovered, almost as if drawn to it.

**[You have been summoned to this world. The System will guide you through your journey.]**

The words were strange—cryptic—but somehow familiar. His mind struggled to understand. *System? Summoned?* 

**[Your survival depends on your ability to adapt. Beware of the dangers that lie ahead.]**

Ethan read the message again, his hands shaking slightly. What kind of game was this? Why was he here? His heart raced, the weight of panic building in his chest. 

As if to punctuate the tension, the forest seemed to grow quieter. The air felt thick, pressing against him. A low, guttural sound reached his ears from somewhere deep within the trees, echoing in the silence. He turned, straining his ears, his pulse quickening.

It came again—closer this time.

A rustling in the underbrush. The cracking of branches underfoot.

Ethan’s eyes darted around, his heart thundering in his chest. He took a step back, but the dense forest only stretched on, no sign of escape. The air seemed to close in around him, every instinct screaming at him to run, but where?

And then, from the shadows between the glowing trees, a figure moved. 

At first, it was only a blur—something large, shifting in the dim light. Ethan’s breath caught in his throat as the creature stepped into view.

It was massive, covered in dark, matted fur that seemed to absorb the faint glow around it. Its eyes gleamed with an unnatural red light, and its sharp claws scraped against the ground with each slow, deliberate step. The thing had the shape of a beast—predatory, towering, and terrifying in its unnatural stillness.

The tension in the air was palpable. Ethan froze, his body refusing to move, heart pounding in his ears. The creature’s gaze locked with his, and for a moment, all time seemed to stretch, as if the world had paused, waiting.

And then, it took another step forward.
#### **Section 1.4: The First Encounter**

The creature’s red eyes gleamed as it took another step forward, its enormous frame moving with unnatural grace for something so large. Ethan’s heart thundered in his chest as terror gripped him, his instincts screaming at him to run. He stumbled backward, his legs weak and uncooperative, his mind locked in a spiral of panic. *Why can’t I move?* 

The creature’s breath was a low, rumbling growl, and its lips curled back to reveal rows of jagged, yellow teeth. It let out a sickening screech, a sound that vibrated through the very air, and suddenly, it lunged. 

Ethan’s legs gave out from under him. He collapsed backward, his hands scraping against the rough forest floor as he tried in vain to push himself away. His breath came in ragged gasps, and his thoughts were a chaotic jumble of fear and confusion. *This is it. I’m going to die here.*

The Decay beast was upon him in an instant, its claws slashing through the air with deadly precision. Ethan could see the sickly green light flickering in its eyes as it bore down on him, its grotesque form blocking out the dim light of the forest.

He flailed, trying to get his hands on anything to defend himself, but everything felt too slow, too distant. The beast’s mouth opened wide, revealing sharp teeth that dripped with a viscous, black substance. It was ready to strike.

Just as its claws neared his chest, Ethan squeezed his eyes shut, bracing for impact. *This is it. I’m done.*

But then, the beast froze.

A sharp, high-pitched sound rang through the air, followed by a powerful crash. The ground beneath Ethan’s hands shook, and the Decay beast howled in pain, its green eyes wide with sudden confusion. A flash of steel gleamed in the dim light as something moved too quickly for Ethan to process—another blur, this one purposeful, precise, and deadly.

The creature screeched again, this time in agony, as a sword plunged deep into its side, the blade glowing with an ethereal light. The beast’s body jerked violently, its monstrous form faltering as the sword cut through the corrupted flesh with ease. A second, quicker blow followed, and the creature collapsed, its body shuddering before it crumpled to the forest floor, lifeless.

Ethan stared up in disbelief, his chest heaving as he tried to make sense of what had just happened. The forest fell into a tense silence, the eerie stillness broken only by his ragged breaths. He could barely move, the adrenaline still surging through his veins, his body shaking uncontrollably.

From the shadows, a figure emerged, tall and confident, silhouetted by the faint glow of the forest around them. The sword gleamed in their hand, dripping with the creature’s dark, corrupted blood.

The figure stepped into the light, and Ethan’s wide eyes locked onto the warrior who had just saved him.
#### **Section 1.5: Lyssara’s Introduction**

Lyssara’s eyes narrowed as she assessed Ethan, still shaken from the ordeal. The Decay beast lay dead at her feet, dispatched with swift precision. Her sword gleamed in the dim light of the forest, and her shield, marked with battle scars, remained steady at her side. She took a step toward Ethan, her gaze unwavering.

“You’re a Summoned One, aren’t you?” she asked, her voice a mix of curiosity and mild exasperation. “You’re lucky I was here.” Her eyes lingered on him, sizing him up as if already deciding what to do next. “You don’t look prepared for what’s ahead. Most aren’t.”

Ethan blinked, the words barely making sense to him. “Summoned One?” he echoed, his voice hoarse. He didn’t understand what she meant, nor how to respond. The weight of everything happening was too much for him to process. His head was still spinning.

Lyssara’s expression softened just a fraction, but there was no mistaking the urgency in her voice. “It’s rare, but it’s known. Scythes are trained to recognize those like you—Summoned Ones. If we find one, we’re supposed to take them in and keep an eye on them. They're often chosen by the gods for something. Whether they’re ready or not.”

She glanced around at the surrounding forest, the tension in the air thick as the sound of distant creatures echoed through the trees. “You were summoned here for a reason, and that reason is likely tied to the gods' plans. But right now, if you want to survive, the first thing you need to do is stay alive. And that means following me.”

Ethan’s heart raced, his mind still struggling to wrap around the gravity of her words. *Summoned by the gods?* He had no idea how to reconcile the normal world he had left behind with the one that now seemed to be unfolding in front of him. The sense of danger was everywhere.

“Where are we going?” he asked, his voice trembling.

“Haven’s Reach,” Lyssara said without missing a beat. “It’s the closest village. We’ll get there and figure things out. But you’ll need to stay close. Keep up, or you won’t last out here.”

Ethan nodded, though he wasn’t sure if he was ready for whatever lay ahead. His gaze shifted back toward the Decay beast’s corpse, still too real, too close. He had no idea what he had just stepped into, but it was clear that the only choice he had was to follow.

Lyssara turned, already heading deeper into the forest, her movements swift and purposeful. Ethan hesitated for a moment, taking a deep breath to steady himself. Then, gathering whatever courage he could find, he followed. The weight of the unknown pressed heavily on his chest, but at least he wasn’t alone. Not completely.

As they left the site of his summoning behind, the eerie stillness of the forest seemed to close in around them.
#### **Section 1.6: Path to Haven's Reach**

The forest path stretched ahead, narrow and winding, its edges thick with tangled undergrowth. Lyssara moved with purpose, her boots crunching softly on the earth, each step confident and assured. Her eyes scanned the surrounding woods constantly, her posture relaxed but alert. Ethan trailed behind, his pace hesitant, every crack of a twig underfoot making him jump. He had no idea what to expect next, and the unfamiliar forest, with its strange glowing trees and distant sounds, only added to his unease.

“Stay close,” Lyssara called back without turning, her voice sharp and clear.

Ethan quickened his step, keeping pace with her, but his thoughts were still racing. *What is this place? What am I doing here?* The world felt entirely different from the one he had left behind. The creatures, the dangers, the sense of something bigger looming—it was all overwhelming. He wanted to ask questions, but every time he opened his mouth, the words seemed to disappear before he could say them.

Lyssara glanced over her shoulder as they walked. “You look like you’ve never seen anything like this before. Can’t say I blame you.” Her tone was casual, but there was an edge to it, a clarity that made Ethan feel both more lost and slightly comforted at the same time. “Eryne is a harsh place. And I don’t mean just the wildlife. There’s a lot at play here that you won’t understand yet.”

Ethan hesitated before speaking. “Eryne... The gods summoned me here. But why? What am I supposed to do?”

Lyssara’s lips tightened briefly, but she didn’t break her stride. “You’ll figure that out soon enough. Maybe the gods have their reasons. But right now, what you need to know is that the System governs everything here. It tracks your progress, your stats, your abilities... everything. If you want to survive, you need to pay attention to it. It’s the key to understanding your place in all this.”

Ethan frowned, still not grasping the full picture. “The System?”

Lyssara nodded, her voice softer now but still firm. “It’s like a... framework for the world. You won’t see it all at once, but it’s there, and it’s real. It’s how people level up, how they gain power, how they’re chosen. For you, it’ll be the difference between life and death.” She paused, glancing at him, as if reading his confused expression. “You’re not just here for sightseeing. You’re part of something bigger. The sooner you understand that, the better.”

Ethan’s head was spinning. *Level up? Chosen?* But he couldn’t find the words to question her further. Everything she said felt like a piece of a puzzle that he couldn’t quite put together. He didn’t know how to respond, so he fell silent, focusing on the steady crunch of leaves underfoot and the rustle of leaves as they made their way deeper into the forest.

Despite the unease gnawing at him, he couldn’t help but feel a strange sense of safety in Lyssara’s presence. Her confidence was like a shield around him, and for all his confusion, he found himself trusting her. She was leading him through this unfamiliar world with a steady hand, even if he didn’t understand everything yet.

The path ahead opened into a clearing, and in the distance, Ethan finally saw it—a cluster of buildings, nestled at the edge of a wide river. The village was small but welcoming, with lights glowing from within the windows of cottages and the sound of voices carried on the wind. It looked peaceful, almost serene, but Ethan knew better than to let his guard down.

“There it is,” Lyssara said, her voice softer now. “Haven’s Reach. It’s not much, but it’s safe. For now.”

Ethan’s heart thudded in his chest as the village grew closer. This was his first glimpse of a world that wasn’t the one he had known. It was a world full of unknowns, danger, and power—if he could only learn to navigate it.

As they drew nearer to the village, Lyssara led the way, and Ethan followed, the unknown stretching ahead, but with each step, a part of him began to settle. The path wasn’t clear yet, but it was a start.
