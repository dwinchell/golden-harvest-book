#### **2.1: Arrival at Haven’s Reach**

Ethan’s feet finally touched the dirt path that led to Haven’s Reach, his legs aching from the long journey. The dense forest parted before them, revealing the village ahead—modest, but fortified, with a few dozen homes clustered together inside a sturdy stone wall. Watchtowers rose at each corner, their wooden frames creaking in the wind, the only indication that this quiet, seemingly peaceful settlement was always on alert.

The village sat at the edge of the wilderness, where the untamed wilds of Eryne met the more cultivated lands of human settlement. Beyond the walls, the forest stretched on, thick with danger, home to creatures and forces that no one could fully tame. The contrast between the safety within the walls and the chaos just outside felt almost surreal to Ethan.

“This is Haven’s Reach,” Lyssara said, her voice steady as she glanced around at the village’s modest buildings. The homes were simple, built from wood and stone, with thatched roofs that appeared to be well-maintained. A few villagers were moving about, but the atmosphere was quiet—peaceful, almost. The wind carried the faint scent of pine and fresh earth, the kind of air that felt untouched by civilization.

But Lyssara’s expression was one of constant vigilance, her gaze sweeping over the surroundings with practiced ease. “This village serves as a buffer,” she continued, guiding Ethan further into the heart of Haven’s Reach. “It’s the last line of defense before the wilderness. Travelers, traders, farmers—this is where they come to find some measure of safety.”

Ethan took in the sight of the people bustling around, though their movements seemed cautious. There was an air of wariness to every exchange, as though every villager knew how quickly things could turn dangerous. He saw men and women gathering at the market stalls, exchanging goods, but there was no laughter or easy conversation—just the quiet hum of necessity.

They passed by a blacksmith, the rhythmic clang of hammer on metal echoing from inside the workshop. The smith, a tall man with a thick beard and calloused hands, paused only long enough to nod at Lyssara before returning to his work. He was busy forging weapons, Ethan realized, his gaze flickering to the sword hanging from the man’s belt. It wasn’t uncommon for people in frontier towns to carry weapons, but there was something about the way the villagers here moved—like they were always ready for something to go wrong.

Ethan began to understand that peace in Haven’s Reach was a fragile thing. It could be shattered at any moment by the forces of the wilderness just beyond their walls. Lyssara led him to the center of the village, where a small crowd was gathered around a fire. They were talking in hushed voices, casting wary glances at the sky.

“This village has been standing for years,” Lyssara continued, her tone even but heavy with the weight of experience. “But that doesn’t mean it’s immune to the threats beyond. Decay beasts, raiders, creatures that slip through the cracks of the wilderness... They all come for Haven’s Reach sooner or later.”

Ethan watched the villagers around them, feeling the tension that lingered in the air. They weren’t just surviving—they were constantly preparing for what could come next. There was no real safety, only the hope that they would be ready when the danger finally reached them.

As they walked deeper into the village, the realization hit Ethan: this was life in the wilds of Eryne. The safety of a quiet village was a temporary illusion, and the constant threat of death was always present. It was a harsh world, but one that Lyssara and the people of Haven’s Reach had learned to navigate with caution, resilience, and a deep understanding of the dangers lurking beyond the walls.

And for the first time since he arrived in Eryne, Ethan began to feel the weight of what it would take to survive here.
#### **2.2: Understanding Eryne's Mechanics**

The warmth of the Haven’s Reach inn provided a welcome contrast to the chill that lingered in Ethan’s bones. The flickering firelight cast long shadows across the room, but all he could focus on was the overwhelming weight of the world around him. Lyssara sat across from him, her demeanor calm, though there was a seriousness to her that matched the gravity of their conversation.

“You need to understand how everything works here, Ethan,” Lyssara began, her tone firm. “It’s all about the System.”

Ethan leaned in slightly, the term still foreign to him. “The System?”

Lyssara nodded. “The System is how everything is tracked in this world. It records your progress, your stats, and your abilities. It’s how mortals grow and develop in Eryne.” She paused, her gaze steady. “Everyone has a potential class that develops as they level up, but there’s more to it than that. The gods have their hand in this. The System itself is directly influenced by the gods, and they shape people’s paths in ways you can’t control.”

Ethan frowned, trying to process this new information. “So, the gods... they control everything?”

“Not everything, but they control the blessings they bestow,” Lyssara clarified. “The System tracks your development, but the gods grant power to a select few. These are the ones they choose to bless, to elevate to something more. If you’re chosen, you gain the favor of a god, and that blessing can unlock abilities, powers—things the average mortal can never attain.”

Ethan felt a knot tighten in his stomach. He was still struggling to accept the concept of gods influencing the very course of his life. “And how do I know if I’m one of those chosen ones?”

Lyssara gave him a small, knowing smile. “That’s something you’ll have to prove. Your path will unfold as you engage with the world. If you’re fortunate enough to be blessed, you’ll find yourself becoming more powerful, more capable. But that’s not something that happens instantly—it’s something you’ll work toward.”

Ethan nodded, but still felt a sense of unease. How could he possibly know if he was chosen? It all felt too overwhelming.

Lyssara, sensing his hesitation, offered him a more direct example. “Let me show you how this works. Show me your character sheet.”

Ethan looked at her, confused. “My what?”

Lyssara motioned to the air between them, and with a flick of her hand, a translucent screen materialized in front of him. It glowed softly, displaying a series of numbers and symbols.

“This is your character sheet,” she explained. “It’s how the System tracks your stats, your progress, and potential. Go ahead—show me your stats.”

Ethan stared at the screen, still not entirely sure what to expect. The screen displayed his name at the top: *Ethan*—simple and unremarkable. Underneath, there were a series of categories: *Strength*, *Agility*, *Intelligence*, and others. Each of these categories had a low number next to them, all set to 1.

Beneath those, it read: *Class: None* and *Level: 0*. There were no skills listed—nothing but an empty slate.

He blinked, surprised by how... basic everything seemed. “Is this all I am right now?”

Lyssara nodded. “Yes. Your stats are low because you haven’t done anything yet to influence them. You have no class because, as a Summoned One, your class hasn’t developed yet. You need to experience the world—make choices, face challenges. Your class will develop as you adapt to this new life.”

Ethan looked back at the screen, feeling a strange sense of inadequacy. “So, I’m basically... nothing?”

Lyssara’s eyes softened, and she gave a short, understanding laugh. “Not nothing. You’re a Summoned One, and that alone means something. You’ve been chosen for a reason, even if you don’t know what that reason is yet. The System just hasn’t revealed your class. Your journey will shape who you become.”

Ethan felt his chest tighten. It was a lot to take in, and the feeling of being so unprepared for this world only intensified. “So, my class will just... come to me as I get stronger?”

Lyssara’s voice became more serious. “Yes. But it’s also about more than just strength. It’s about what you stand for, what you believe in, and who you align yourself with. That’s where the gods come in. The gods bless individuals who align with their ideals.”

“Merithera and Arceon,” Ethan said, recalling some of what Lyssara had told him earlier.

Lyssara nodded. “Exactly. Merithera, goddess of harvest, protection, and balance. Her followers value harmony and life. The Covenant, her faction, is about growth, nurturing, and the protection of the land. Arceon, on the other hand, leads the Zenith. His followers value power, strength, and domination. They seek to rise above others, to control and conquer.”

Ethan took a slow breath. “And the gods decide who gets to be blessed?”

“Yes,” Lyssara confirmed. “The gods choose who they empower. They look for individuals who reflect their values and ideals. It’s why your connection to Merithera might be significant. You’ve been summoned, and the System may align you with her. But it’s up to you to prove that you’re worthy of her blessing.”

Ethan glanced back at the character sheet, still trying to process everything. It felt like so much had changed in such a short time. The weight of the gods’ influence on his life, the potential for power—everything seemed tied to choices he hadn’t even made yet.

Lyssara continued, her gaze steady. “Don’t rush to understand it all, Ethan. Just know that you’re on a path, and that path will lead you to what you need to do. The System will help guide you, but your connection to a god could shape everything. The question is: will you prove yourself worthy of their favor?”

Ethan looked at the glowing screen, his thoughts heavy with the possibility of what lay ahead. He didn’t have answers, but one thing was becoming clearer: his life in Eryne had just begun, and the choices he made now would shape his future in ways he couldn’t yet comprehend.
#### **2.3: The Ever-Present Threat of Decay Beasts**

The sound of hurried footsteps broke the quiet hum of the inn, followed by a soft knock at the door. Lyssara’s gaze flickered toward the entrance, her expression hardening. Without a word, she rose from her seat and crossed the room, opening the door to reveal a young man, breathless and wide-eyed with urgency.

“Lyssara,” the young man gasped, “we’ve spotted Decay beasts near the southern border of the village. A small pack, but they’re moving fast.”

Lyssara’s face tightened as she absorbed the news. “Decay beasts again?” she muttered under her breath, before addressing the young man. “Gather the militia. Get them ready. I’ll meet you there.”

As the man nodded and hurried off, Lyssara turned to Ethan, her face grim. “Decay beasts are a constant threat,” she explained, her voice steady but laced with a seriousness that brooked no delay. “They’re corrupted creatures—beasts born from the dark forces of decay. They infect the land, devouring everything in their path. If they’re not stopped, they spread their blight, consuming villages and turning the earth barren.”

Ethan’s stomach churned at the thought. “So they’re like... monsters? But worse?”

Lyssara gave him a brief nod. “Monsters that are part of a greater corruption. They’re relentless, and their attacks are not uncommon. This isn’t the first time we’ve dealt with them, but it’s always a threat. We have to remain vigilant.”

The atmosphere in the inn shifted as news of the beasts spread. Villagers gathered their families, securing their homes and preparing for what was to come. The sound of boots marching and weapons clanging grew louder as the local militia began to mobilize, an organized calm settling over them despite the urgency.

Ethan watched as the village sprang into action, his eyes wide as he observed the people around him. These weren’t just farmers and traders—these were people who had honed the skill of survival in a world where danger was ever-present. They moved with purpose, readying their weapons, reinforcing the walls, and setting up barricades. Even the elderly and children seemed to understand their roles in maintaining the village’s defenses, offering assistance where they could.

“They’re prepared,” Ethan said quietly, more to himself than to Lyssara.

Lyssara glanced at him, nodding. “They have to be. Every day here is a challenge, and they know that. They’re hardy. Capable. The people here are always on guard because they understand that safety is never guaranteed.”

She turned toward the corner where her own weapons were stored—her sword, gleaming in the firelight, and a sturdy shield, both worn from years of use but well-maintained. She took a deep breath, tightening her grip on the hilt. “The Decay beasts won’t stop coming unless we stop them. It’s up to us to hold the line.”

Lyssara turned to face Ethan. “You need to prepare yourself too. You’ll be helping defend the village, whether you’re ready or not.” 

Ethan felt a surge of uncertainty in his chest. He had no training, no experience with anything like this. How could he help? But before he could voice his hesitation, Lyssara was already moving toward him, pulling a short practice sword from the wall and handing it to him.

“Here,” she said. “We’ll start with the basics. You need to know how to defend yourself at the very least.” She stepped back, her gaze unwavering. “Keep your stance wide. Feet shoulder-width apart. Hold the blade firmly, but don’t overgrip it. You need control, not brute strength.”

Ethan hesitated for a moment before taking the sword. It felt strange in his hands—awkward and foreign. He lifted it, trying to mimic Lyssara’s stance. She watched him for a moment, then moved in with a swift motion, tapping the tip of her sword against his.

“Good,” she said, but her eyes held a note of concern. “You’re untrained, but we don’t have time for hesitation. You have to react, Ethan. When you’re facing danger, hesitation can cost you your life.”

He nodded, trying to focus on her words, but the reality of the situation was beginning to hit him. He had no idea what he was doing, and yet, in a world like this, he had no choice but to try.

Lyssara stepped back, assessing him with a critical eye. “I’ll teach you what I can in the short time we have. The rest will come with experience. But remember, survival here is as much about your will as it is your skill. You need to be ready to fight if it comes to that.”

Ethan swallowed, gripping the sword tighter, determination flickering in his chest. He wasn’t ready for this, not by any means—but the village needed him, and he couldn’t just stand by. 

As Lyssara led him toward the village’s defenses, Ethan’s thoughts were a mix of fear and resolve. The Decay beasts were a terrifying force, but for the first time since his arrival in Eryne, he began to understand that survival here would demand more than just physical strength—it would demand everything he had.
#### **2.4: Growing Tension and Realization**

The chill of the evening air pressed in around the village as Ethan followed Lyssara through the streets, the sound of hurried footsteps and clanging weapons echoing from the militia preparing for the oncoming threat. The quiet murmur of the villagers preparing for the Decay beasts was punctuated by the occasional shout, and the sense of urgency was palpable. Even though the village had a semblance of order, the tension hung thick like a cloud. 

Ethan felt the weight of the world bearing down on him as they reached the village’s outer barricades. The sight of the guards nervously adjusting their weapons, their eyes darting to the forest’s edge, made his heart race. He was far from ready to face whatever creatures lurked out there.

*What am I doing here?* Ethan thought, his stomach tight. *I’m not equipped for this. I’m not ready.* His hands gripped the sword Lyssara had given him, the unfamiliar weight making his palms sweat. He thought of his old life—his job, his tiny apartment, the mundane routine that had once felt like a cage but now seemed like the only thing he could understand. *I wasn’t cut out for this. I’m not a warrior. I’m not a hero.*

He glanced at Lyssara, who was speaking to the militia, issuing orders with sharp precision. She moved with the confidence of someone who had faced this countless times before. *She’s been through this. She knows what she’s doing,* Ethan thought, feeling a sharp pang of self-doubt. How could he possibly measure up? How could he, with his empty character sheet and untested skills, help defend the village from beasts of decay?

“Ethan,” Lyssara’s voice cut through his spiraling thoughts. He turned to see her looking at him with a stern, but not unkind, expression. “I can see it in your face. You’re thinking about running.”

Ethan opened his mouth, but the words didn’t come. He couldn’t admit the truth, not even to himself—he was terrified. Terrified of failing, terrified of the unknown.

Lyssara took a step toward him, her eyes unwavering. “It’s normal to feel afraid. You’re not supposed to be comfortable with this. Nobody is when they start. But you need to understand something.” She placed a firm hand on his shoulder, looking him in the eyes. “Survival here isn’t about being the strongest. It’s about being adaptable. Knowing when to fight, when to run, and when to rely on your instincts. The System can only guide you so far. The rest comes from within.”

Ethan nodded slowly, though his mind was still a whirlwind of doubts. He wanted to ask her how she could be so certain, but her gaze softened, as if she could read his thoughts. “I’ve had my fair share of doubts too, Ethan,” she said, her voice low. “I didn’t start out as the confident warrior you see now. I was like you once—new to all this. But I learned. I had no choice but to.”

Lyssara’s words hung in the air as she stepped back, unsheathing her sword with practiced ease. “I didn’t become a warrior because I was born to it. I became one because I had to survive. I learned how to fight, how to think on my feet, how to trust myself in the heat of battle. And most of all, I learned that survival isn’t just about strength or skill—it’s about being able to take the hits and keep moving forward.”

Ethan watched as she demonstrated a series of basic stances, her movements fluid and precise. He was amazed by how effortlessly she handled her weapon. Then, she turned back to him. “You need to stop thinking of yourself as weak. You’re stronger than you think, Ethan. But you won’t know it until you stop doubting yourself.”

Her words lingered as Ethan glanced down at the sword in his hands, the weight of it suddenly feeling a little less foreign. He still wasn’t sure he could ever become like her, but part of him wanted to try. Part of him wanted to be strong enough to stand with the villagers, to face whatever was out there in the wilderness, and not back down.

Lyssara’s voice brought him back to the present. “We’ll start small. You don’t need to be perfect, but you need to keep moving forward. Just focus on the basics for now.”

She walked him through several basic stances again, correcting his posture as she went. The first few attempts felt clumsy, his hands unsure of their place on the sword’s hilt, his feet shifting nervously. But with every correction, he began to feel more in control. The more he focused on the movements, the more the doubts in his head quieted. His grip steadied, and his stance became firmer, more confident.

Ethan didn’t become a fighter in that moment, but something began to change. The fear that had been choking him started to loosen its grip. He wasn’t ready to face the Decay beasts yet—not by a long shot—but he understood that he could take the first steps toward being ready. 

When Lyssara finally called a halt to the training, she gave him a measured nod. “Good. You’re starting to get the hang of it. You’re not a warrior yet, but you’re learning.”

Ethan’s chest rose and fell with a mixture of exhaustion and pride. He wasn’t sure what was waiting for him out in the dark, but for the first time since being summoned to Eryne, he felt like maybe, just maybe, he could survive.
#### **2.5: The Calm Before the Storm**

Nightfall settled over Haven’s Reach like a heavy blanket, shrouding the village in an eerie stillness. The vibrant sounds of the day had long since quieted, replaced by the distant murmur of people preparing for what they knew was coming. In the fading light of the evening, the village seemed almost peaceful—too peaceful, given the looming threat.

Villagers moved with practiced efficiency, locking doors, securing windows, and reinforcing the walls with every available resource. The air was thick with tension, and the usual comfort of the evening routine felt unnervingly hollow. A few families lingered outside for a moment longer, exchanging quiet words before retreating into their homes. The children, eyes wide with fear, clung to their mothers, who whispered reassuring words that sounded hollow even to Ethan’s ears.

Lyssara walked beside him, her pace measured, but Ethan could feel the tension in her every step. Her expression was calm, yet there was an undercurrent of something darker, something more urgent.

“This is how it always goes,” she said, breaking the silence between them. “The village prepares, knowing that the Decay beasts could strike at any time. But this—this isn’t the worst we face.”

Ethan turned to her, confusion lining his features. “What do you mean? The Decay beasts... they’re dangerous, right? Shouldn’t we be focused on them?”

Lyssara’s gaze hardened as she glanced at the militia preparing at the gates, their faces set with grim determination. “Decay beasts are just symptoms of a much larger problem. They’re nothing compared to the real threat—the conflict between the gods.”

Ethan’s heart skipped. “The gods?”

Lyssara nodded, her eyes narrowing. “The Decay beasts are part of it. They’re manifestations of the corruption spreading from Arceon’s influence, but the true danger lies in the war between the gods themselves. The Covenant and the Zenith—they’re locked in a battle for control, and their struggle could tear apart the very fabric of this world.”

The weight of her words settled heavily on Ethan’s shoulders. He had heard of gods, of factions, of divine influence, but hearing it from Lyssara made it all feel far more real—and far more dangerous.

Ethan’s voice was barely a whisper. “So... I’m part of this? My being here... it’s tied to this war?”

Lyssara’s eyes met his, her expression unreadable for a long moment. “Yes. You’re not just here by chance, Ethan. The gods don’t summon people to this world without purpose. The conflict between them is reaching its peak. The Decay beasts are just the beginning. The real battle will be fought through those like you—those who have been summoned. And you’ll have to choose which side you’re on, sooner or later.”

Ethan stood frozen in place for a moment, the enormity of what she was saying sinking in. His entire existence in Eryne, his reason for being here—he had no idea that it was tied to something so much bigger than he could have ever imagined. His presence wasn’t just a twist of fate—it was a part of a war between gods, and it was a war that could change everything.

The night deepened, and the village seemed to hold its breath, every person on high alert. The air grew colder, the shadows darker, and Ethan felt that familiar unease creep back into his chest. This place, this world—it wasn’t just unfamiliar. It was dangerous. And it wasn’t going to let him leave easily.

Suddenly, from the corner of his eye, Ethan noticed a shadow at the edge of the village, moving quickly and with purpose. It was hard to make out the shape in the dark, but there was something unmistakably menacing about it. His heart skipped as the figure seemed to melt into the surrounding darkness, barely visible in the moonlight.

Lyssara stiffened beside him, her eyes narrowing as she followed his gaze. “Get ready,” she murmured. “The Decay beasts are close.”

The shadow moved again, this time closer, its shape more defined in the dim light. It wasn’t human. It wasn’t even animal. It was something worse, something that made the hairs on the back of Ethan’s neck stand on end.

He could feel his pulse racing as the weight of the moment pressed in. The villagers were readying themselves, positioning weapons and looking to Lyssara for guidance. But Ethan couldn’t shake the feeling that this was only the beginning. What they faced tonight was nothing compared to what was coming.

Lyssara turned to him, her face set with grim determination. “Stay close. Stay alert.”

As she moved toward the militia, Ethan’s breath hitched. The figure at the edge of the village moved again, slipping into the shadows. He wasn’t sure if it was the Decay beasts—or something far worse—but the threat was undeniable. And the storm was coming.

For the first time since his arrival in Eryne, Ethan realized the depth of the danger surrounding him. This world was far more dangerous than he had ever imagined, and the battle wasn’t just for survival—it was for the very soul of Eryne itself.
