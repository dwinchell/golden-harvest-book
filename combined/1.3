#### **Section 1.3: Arrival in Eryne**

Ethan’s eyes snapped open, and for a moment, he thought he was still trapped in the swirling vortex. But the air was different now—cool and still, thick with the scent of pine and earth. His mind raced, disoriented as he tried to make sense of his surroundings. He was lying on soft moss, the ground beneath him damp, and as he pushed himself up, he realized the gravity of the situation. 

The world around him was unlike anything he had ever seen.

The trees towered above him, their trunks thick and glowing faintly with an eerie, golden light. Their leaves shimmered, not like ordinary foliage but as though they were bathed in a soft, otherworldly glow. The forest stretched endlessly, the canopy forming an almost unbroken ceiling of light. Everything had an unnatural stillness, as if the forest itself was holding its breath, waiting for something.

Ethan’s heart pounded in his chest as his mind tried to piece together what was happening. Was this some kind of dream? A hallucination? His head spun as he staggered to his feet, but a sudden wave of dizziness made him lean against a nearby tree for support. The bark felt warm against his palm, and he swore he could hear faint whispers within the trunk, like voices trapped in the wood.

Before he could make sense of it, a flash of light cut through his vision—an iridescent, translucent screen that appeared right in front of him. It hovered in midair, glowing with an unnatural brightness as text materialized, slowly forming words.

**[Welcome, Ethan, to Eryne.]**

Ethan blinked, confusion spreading through him like a cold sweat. He took a step back, but the screen stayed with him, suspended in the air. His fingers hovered, almost as if drawn to it.

**[You have been summoned to this world. The System will guide you through your journey.]**

The words were strange—cryptic—but somehow familiar. His mind struggled to understand. *System? Summoned?* 

**[Your survival depends on your ability to adapt. Beware of the dangers that lie ahead.]**

Ethan read the message again, his hands shaking slightly. What kind of game was this? Why was he here? His heart raced, the weight of panic building in his chest. 

As if to punctuate the tension, the forest seemed to grow quieter. The air felt thick, pressing against him. A low, guttural sound reached his ears from somewhere deep within the trees, echoing in the silence. He turned, straining his ears, his pulse quickening.

It came again—closer this time.

A rustling in the underbrush. The cracking of branches underfoot.

Ethan’s eyes darted around, his heart thundering in his chest. He took a step back, but the dense forest only stretched on, no sign of escape. The air seemed to close in around him, every instinct screaming at him to run, but where?

And then, from the shadows between the glowing trees, a figure moved. 

At first, it was only a blur—something large, shifting in the dim light. Ethan’s breath caught in his throat as the creature stepped into view.

It was massive, covered in dark, matted fur that seemed to absorb the faint glow around it. Its eyes gleamed with an unnatural red light, and its sharp claws scraped against the ground with each slow, deliberate step. The thing had the shape of a beast—predatory, towering, and terrifying in its unnatural stillness.

The tension in the air was palpable. Ethan froze, his body refusing to move, heart pounding in his ears. The creature’s gaze locked with his, and for a moment, all time seemed to stretch, as if the world had paused, waiting.

And then, it took another step forward.
