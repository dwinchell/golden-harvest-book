Before drafting a scene, it’s important to make several decisions to ensure the scene is focused, meaningful, and aligned with the story's goals. Here's what to consider:

1. Scene Purpose
Why does this scene exist?
Determine the primary function of the scene in the narrative. It could:
Advance the plot.
Develop a character.
Introduce or reinforce a theme.
Build tension or resolve conflict.
Example:
Scene Purpose: Show Ethan stepping into his role as a Harvester during his first battle.
2. Key Events
What happens in the scene?
Outline the significant actions or events. Each event should have a purpose and lead to the next logically.
Example:
Key Events:
Decay beasts breach the village defenses.
Ethan hesitates but overcomes his fear to save a villager.
Lyssara acknowledges his effort, boosting his confidence.
3. Character Goals
What does each character want?
Identify the protagonist’s and other characters’ goals within the scene.
Consider whether these goals are achieved or thwarted.
Example:
Ethan’s Goal: Prove his worth by defending the village.
Lyssara’s Goal: Protect the villagers and mentor Ethan.
4. Stakes and Conflict
What is at risk in this scene?
Determine the stakes for the characters and how the scene escalates the central conflict.
Identify external (physical danger) and internal (emotional or moral struggle) conflicts.
Example:
Stakes: If Ethan fails, the villagers may die, and he’ll feel like a failure.
Conflict: Ethan struggles with fear while battling a Decay beast.
5. Emotional Beat
What is the emotional tone or change?
Decide how the scene contributes to the emotional journey of the characters and readers.
Consider the starting and ending emotional states.
Example:
Emotional Beat: The scene starts with fear and doubt but ends with a sense of accomplishment and hope.
6. Setting
Where does the scene take place?
Choose a setting that enhances the mood, stakes, or conflict.
Add sensory details that ground the scene and make it vivid.
Example:
Setting: The outskirts of Haven’s Reach at twilight, with shadows deepening as Decay beasts emerge.
7. Pacing and Length
How long will the scene be?
Decide whether the scene will be fast-paced (e.g., action-heavy) or slower (e.g., reflective or dialog-driven).
Consider the balance with adjacent scenes.
8. Theme
How does the scene reinforce the theme?
Identify how the scene ties into the story’s central or supporting themes.
Example:
Theme Connection: Ethan’s teamwork with Lyssara reflects Collaborative Leadership.
9. Transitions
How does the scene begin and end?
Determine how the scene connects to the previous and next scenes.
Establish the starting context and plan a strong hook or ending beat.
Example:
Hook: A villager screams, signaling the Decay beasts’ attack.
Ending Beat: Ethan stands over the defeated beast, breathing heavily, as Lyssara nods approvingly.
10. Key Details
What details must be included?
Identify specific information (e.g., clues, worldbuilding, or foreshadowing) that the scene must convey.
Example:
Key Details: Show the effects of Decay spreading through the forest near the village.
