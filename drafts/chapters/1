### Chapter 1: The Weight of the World

The rumble of traffic outside the window felt like an unending reminder of everything Ethan wanted to escape. The dingy apartment smelled faintly of burnt coffee and leftover takeout, and the hum of his outdated computer was the only other sound accompanying him. The screen glowed with an email from his boss, a curt message reminding him about a missed deadline and the "urgent need to pick up the pace."

Ethan leaned back in his creaky chair, letting out a long sigh. This wasn’t the life he’d envisioned. Long hours at a dead-end job, a paycheck barely covering his rent, and the persistent weight of loneliness that had become his closest companion. He thought of his parents, whose voices still echoed in his head with criticism sharper than any blade. **You’ll never amount to anything if you keep wasting time on fantasy books and games.**

The books and games had been his sanctuary once, a place where heroes triumphed, where broken worlds could be saved, and where people like him could matter. But now, even those had lost their shine. His fantasy novels sat in a dusty pile on the shelf, untouched for months. The games he used to love were installed but unopened, their icons a mockery of his inability to find joy in anything anymore.

Ethan’s gaze drifted to the cracked plaster of the ceiling. “There has to be more than this,” he muttered.

Later that evening, Ethan found himself outside, walking aimlessly through the crowded city streets. The neon lights of the convenience store reflected in puddles on the sidewalk, and the chatter of people passing by barely registered. He didn’t know where he was going, but he needed to get out of the apartment—out of his head. His steps carried him to a small park, empty save for a few benches and a flickering streetlamp that cast jagged shadows across the cracked pavement.

He sat down heavily, the damp chill of the bench soaking through his jacket. A part of him thought about calling someone—his roommate, maybe, though they were more an obligation than a friend. But what would he even say? **I’m tired of feeling stuck. I want to be someone else.**

Ethan’s thoughts spiraled, his fingers tracing the edge of his phone. The weight of his own mediocrity pressed on his chest like a stone. “If I could just… start over,” he whispered to no one.

When the light appeared, Ethan thought at first it was the streetlamp finally giving up. But this wasn’t the yellow glow of a malfunctioning bulb. It was white and piercing, like a sudden tear in reality had opened before him. His phone slipped from his hand, clattering to the ground as he stared at the shimmering orb that hovered inches above the pavement.

“What the hell?” he muttered, scrambling to his feet. The light grew brighter, its edges flickering like fire and collapsing inward as if it were pulling the world into itself. It was beautiful and terrifying all at once.

Ethan backed away instinctively, but the light surged forward, tendrils of energy snaking toward him. Panic gripped his chest as he tried to run, but the ground felt like it was spinning beneath him. The light enveloped him, searing through his body with an unbearable heat that wasn’t pain but something deeper—something that reached into his very being.

The world dissolved around him.

When Ethan opened his eyes, the forest canopy stretched high above him, golden sunlight filtering through the leaves. The air smelled clean and sharp, carrying the scent of damp earth and pine. For a moment, he thought he was dreaming. But the dampness of the moss beneath his fingers and the faint ache in his limbs told him otherwise.

“Where… am I?” he whispered, his voice hoarse. He sat up, the unfamiliar weight of his body making him dizzy. Gone were the sounds of the city; instead, he heard birds chirping and the rustle of leaves in the breeze.

His heart raced as he took in his surroundings. Towering trees stretched as far as he could see, their trunks massive and gnarled with age. In the distance, a faint humming sound caught his attention, rhythmic and unnatural amidst the natural symphony of the forest.

Ethan pushed himself to his feet, wobbling slightly as he adjusted to the unfamiliar environment. His clothes were the same—the jeans and jacket he’d worn earlier—but they felt out of place here. He patted his pockets, finding his phone still there. Pulling it out, he saw the screen was cracked, and the device wouldn’t turn on.

“Great,” he muttered, shoving it back into his pocket. “Now what?”

The humming grew louder, accompanied by a faint, otherworldly glow. Ethan’s curiosity warred with his fear, but something compelled him to move toward it. Maybe it was hope—hope that someone else was here, someone who could explain what had happened.

---

As he approached the source of the sound, the forest opened into a small clearing. In the center was a wolf, its form twisted and grotesque. Its fur was mottled with patches of decay, and its eyes glowed with a sickly green light. The creature growled low, its head snapping toward Ethan as if sensing his presence.

“Oh, shit,” Ethan breathed, backing up slowly. He glanced around for a weapon, but the forest offered little beyond rocks and branches.

The wolf lunged, and instinct took over. Ethan dove to the side, the creature’s claws ripping through the air where he’d stood moments before. Scrambling to his feet, he grabbed a sturdy branch and swung wildly as the wolf charged again. The makeshift weapon connected with a sickening thud, and the wolf stumbled back, snarling.

A sudden notification appeared before his eyes, glowing faintly in the air:

**[New Skill Unlocked: Improvised Combat]**

“What the…?” Ethan barely had time to process the text before the wolf attacked again. This time, he managed to sidestep and bring the branch down on its back. The creature howled, collapsing to the ground in a heap.

Ethan stood there, panting, as the wolf’s body dissolved into faint green particles that drifted upward before disappearing. Another notification appeared:

**[Essence Gained: 10]**

His mind raced. **This isn’t real. This can’t be real.** But the ache in his arms and the adrenaline coursing through his veins felt all too real. The forest seemed to grow quieter, the sounds of the wolf’s attack fading into memory.

Ethan lowered the branch and sank to his knees, his heart pounding. Wherever he was, it was clear: he wasn’t in his world anymore.
