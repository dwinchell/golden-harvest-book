Chapter 1: The Weight of the World
Ethan sat alone in the tiny kitchen of his apartment, the dull yellow glow of the overhead light casting tired shadows across the room. The walls, painted an uninspiring beige, had seen better days, their surface peeling from years of neglect. A bowl of instant noodles sat untouched in front of him, steam curling into the stale air. He stirred the noodles absently, watching the broth ripple. It wasn’t hunger that kept him sitting here—it was exhaustion, the kind that came not just from the body but from the soul.

The day had been like all the others. Eight hours at the call center, listening to people scream at him over problems he had no power to fix. His boss hovered constantly, offering criticism disguised as “advice,” and his coworkers kept their heads down, locked in silent competition for whatever crumbs of recognition were on offer. By the time Ethan clocked out, the only thing he could muster was the energy to drag himself home.

“Out with friends,” read the text from his roommate when Ethan had arrived. Don’t wait up.

Not that Ethan ever expected company. His roommate, an aloof partygoer who treated the apartment as a pit stop between nights out, barely acknowledged his existence. Ethan didn’t blame him. There wasn’t much to acknowledge. He was just the quiet guy who paid his share of the rent and spent his evenings alone in this dim, lifeless apartment.

He pushed the bowl aside and leaned back in his chair, staring at the ceiling. The paint there was cracked too, spiderweb lines splitting apart like the seams of his life. Ethan had never imagined his twenties would turn out like this. As a kid, he’d dreamed of adventure—of leaving behind the small, suffocating town he grew up in and doing something that mattered. Now, at twenty-seven, he was stuck in a different kind of cage.

His parents had been no help. Their criticism still echoed in his mind, the harsh words replaying like a broken record. “Why can’t you be more like your cousin? Look at where you’ve ended up—wasting your potential.” He’d stopped calling them years ago, and they hadn’t seemed to notice. Friends? They’d drifted away, pursuing lives that seemed brighter, fuller, and infinitely better than his own.

Ethan stood and moved to the window, pressing his forehead against the cool glass. The city stretched out before him, its lights blinking like dying stars. Somewhere out there, people were laughing, living, making memories. Ethan felt like a ghost, trapped on the edges of a world that didn’t see him.

He closed his eyes, inhaling deeply. He wished for something—anything—to change. Maybe he didn’t deserve happiness, but surely he wasn’t meant to spend his life like this. There had to be more.

Then, it happened.

A sharp pull in his chest, like an invisible hand grasping his heart. Ethan gasped, stumbling back from the window. The sensation wasn’t physical pain—it was deeper, a force that seemed to reach into his very being. He clutched at his shirt, his pulse racing.

“What the—” he began, but his words were swallowed by a sudden roar, as if the world itself had cracked open.

The room shifted. The walls blurred and shimmered, their solid edges dissolving into streaks of light. The hum of the refrigerator, the faint buzz of the lightbulb—all sound vanished, replaced by an oppressive silence. Ethan tried to move, to scream, but his body refused to obey. He was weightless, suspended in a void of swirling colors.

His vision narrowed, the apartment fading entirely. A white-hot light consumed everything, and for a moment, there was nothing.

Ethan’s senses returned all at once, overwhelming him. The brightness of the sky above made him squint, and the crisp, cool air carried the scent of grass and wildflowers. His hands pressed into soft earth, damp with dew. Slowly, he sat up, his heart pounding as his eyes adjusted to his surroundings.

He wasn’t in his apartment anymore.

Before him stretched a vast meadow, the grass swaying gently in the breeze. Wildflowers in vibrant hues dotted the landscape, their petals shimmering faintly as if catching the light of a distant star. The sky was unlike anything he’d ever seen—a radiant gradient of violet and gold, with clouds that seemed to glow softly. In the distance, rolling hills rose and fell, their edges blurring into the shadowy outline of a dense forest.

“What… where am I?” Ethan’s voice wavered, barely louder than a whisper.

He scrambled to his feet, his legs unsteady. His pulse thudded in his ears as he turned in a slow circle, taking in the unfamiliar world. This wasn’t a dream. It was too vivid, too real. His hand brushed against the grass, and he felt each blade. The cool breeze on his face made him shiver.

A soft chime rang out, clear and melodic. Ethan froze as a translucent window appeared before his eyes, glowing faintly. Text began to scroll across its surface, crisp and sharp:

“What the hell is this?” Ethan stared at the floating text, his voice trembling. He reached out to touch it, but his fingers passed through the glowing surface.

Before he could make sense of what he was seeing, another sound cut through the air—a low, guttural growl. Ethan turned sharply toward the noise, his stomach twisting in fear. From the edge of the meadow, a creature emerged.

It was the size of a large dog, but its body was twisted and wrong. Black fur clung to its sinewy frame, and its eyes glowed a sickly green. Sharp teeth jutted from its snarling mouth, and its movements were erratic, almost unnatural.

Ethan’s breath caught. His instincts screamed at him to run, but his legs felt like lead. The creature crouched, muscles coiling, and then it sprang toward him.

“Move!” Ethan shouted to himself, stumbling backward. He turned and ran, the grass whipping against his legs as he sprinted blindly. The creature’s snarls grew louder behind him, each one sending a spike of terror through his chest.

The ground sloped downward, leading to a shallow creek. Ethan’s foot caught on a root, and he fell hard, his hands scraping against the rocky bank. Pain shot through his palms, but he forced himself up, adrenaline overriding the sting. The creature was almost on him, its glowing eyes locked onto its prey.

Desperately, Ethan grabbed a jagged rock from the creek bed. As the creature lunged, he swung the rock with all his strength. The impact sent a shockwave through his arm, and the creature let out a pained yelp, stumbling back.

But it wasn’t done.

The creature recovered quickly, its snarl deepening. It circled him, saliva dripping from its maw. Ethan’s breath came in shallow gasps as he tightened his grip on the rock. His chances didn’t look good.

A sharp whistle pierced the air, freezing the creature in its tracks. Ethan turned toward the sound, his heart pounding. From the edge of the clearing, a figure emerged.

The woman was clad in armor that gleamed faintly in the sunlight, a longbow in her hands. Her eyes, sharp and piercing, locked onto the creature as she notched an arrow. With a swift, practiced motion, she loosed the arrow, striking the beast in the chest. It let out a final, gurgling snarl before collapsing.

Ethan fell to his knees, his chest heaving. The woman approached, her boots crunching softly against the ground. She stopped a few feet away, her gaze shifting from the dead creature to him.

“You’re lucky I was nearby,” she said, her tone calm but firm. “That thing would’ve torn you apart.”

Ethan tried to respond, but his voice failed him. The woman extended a hand, helping him to his feet. Up close, he could see the intensity in her eyes—a mix of calculation and curiosity.

“Who… what is this place?” he managed to ask, his voice barely above a whisper.

The woman tilted her head slightly, studying him. “The System World,” she said. “And judging by the look on your face, I’d say you’re one of the Summoned.”

“Summoned?” Ethan repeated, the word foreign and heavy on his tongue. “What does that even mean?”

Her lips quirked in a faint smirk. “It means you’ve got a lot to learn. And you’d better learn fast if you want to survive.”

Ethan stared at her, the weight of her words sinking in. Whatever this place was, whatever had brought him here—his life would never be the same.
