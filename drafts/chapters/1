Chapter 1: The Weight of the World

Section 1.1: A Bleak Routine

The shrill beep of an alarm clock jolted Ethan awake. He groaned, swiping a hand across the cluttered nightstand to silence the noise. For a few moments, he lay there, staring at the water-stained ceiling of his apartment. The faint hum of traffic outside was joined by the muffled sounds of neighbors arguing. Another day in paradise.

Dragging himself out of bed, Ethan shuffled to the kitchen, dodging piles of laundry and an overflowing trash can. His roommate, Brad, was sprawled on the couch, surrounded by empty beer cans and the glow of a video game paused on the TV.

“Hey, man,” Brad mumbled without looking up. “We’re out of milk. Can you pick some up on your way back?”

Ethan bit back the urge to snap. Instead, he grabbed a piece of bread from the counter, already hard around the edges, and chewed it without much thought. “Sure,” he muttered, heading out the door. He didn’t have the energy for an argument.

Section 1.2: Exploitation and Despair

The morning air was cool but carried the familiar tang of exhaust fumes. Ethan pulled his jacket tighter as he boarded the crowded bus to his job at Kessler’s Logistics, a warehouse known for treating its employees like numbers. The ride was quiet, save for the occasional screech of brakes and the monotone voice announcing stops.

“C’mon, Ethan. Faster!” barked his supervisor, a stout man with a perpetual scowl. Ethan hefted another box onto the conveyor belt, his arms burning from the effort. “We’ve got deadlines!”

“Yes, sir,” Ethan replied, forcing the words out through gritted teeth. He wasn’t the only one struggling, but complaints always seemed to land on him. It didn’t matter. No one here cared.

By lunch, he was drained. Slumping onto a bench outside, Ethan unwrapped a sandwich he’d made the night before. It was soggy, the lettuce wilted, but he ate it anyway. Around him, coworkers laughed in small groups or scrolled through their phones. He didn’t bother trying to join them. He’d tried once, but it always felt like they were humoring him.

Section 1.3: Memories of Hope

Ethan’s mind wandered as he ate, unbidden memories of summers spent on his grandparents’ farm surfacing. He could almost hear the rustle of wind through golden fields of grain, feel the sun on his face as he helped harvest crops. Those days were hard work, but they meant something. Here, every movement felt meaningless, feeding a machine that didn’t care if he was there or not.

A small smile tugged at his lips, but it faded quickly. That life was gone, buried under years of bad choices, worse luck, and an unshakable feeling that he didn’t belong anywhere. He finished his sandwich and headed back to the grind, his chest heavy with nostalgia.

Section 1.4: The Turning Point

The day ended like all others, with aching muscles and a paycheck that barely covered rent. Ethan trudged home in the dark, the streetlights casting long shadows over cracked sidewalks. When he entered the apartment, Brad was gone, likely at some bar. The silence was almost worse than his presence.

He sank onto his bed, staring at his phone. A missed call from his mom. He hesitated, then dialed back. Her voice was sharp, the conversation predictable. Another guilt trip about not visiting, not helping out enough, not being enough.

By the time the call ended, Ethan felt hollow. He tossed the phone aside and buried his head in his hands. “This can’t be it,” he whispered. “This can’t be all there is.”

Section 1.5: The Summoning

Sleep came slowly, dragging Ethan into a restless haze. Shapes and symbols danced behind his eyelids, glowing faintly against the void. A voice, warm and distant, called out to him.

“Do you want more?”

His chest tightened, and he tried to respond, but no sound came. The warmth intensified, wrapping around him like a blanket. Suddenly, the symbols grew brighter, a golden light flooding his vision.

Ethan’s eyes shot open. He was no longer in his bed. The air was cool, damp, and filled with the scent of pine. Around him stretched a dark forest, the distant sound of rustling leaves breaking the stillness. A single thought echoed in his mind: Where am I?

The weight of his old life was gone, replaced by an uneasy mix of fear and possibility. Ethan stood, brushing dirt from his clothes. For the first time in years, he felt something stir within him—a faint, unfamiliar spark of hope.
