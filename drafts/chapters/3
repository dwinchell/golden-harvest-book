Chapter 3: The First Fight
The air inside the council building was cooler than Ethan expected, though it carried the same earthy, wooden scent as the rest of the village. The room was modest, with plain stone walls and a long wooden table at its center. A handful of people sat around it, their faces weathered and serious. Lyssara led Ethan inside, her presence commanding respect without a word.

“Summoned, you said?” one of the men asked, his gruff voice breaking the silence. His sharp eyes flicked to Ethan, appraising him like a piece of equipment rather than a person.

“Yes,” Lyssara replied, standing tall. “He doesn’t understand our world yet, but the System summoned him here. That alone makes him important.”

Ethan shifted uncomfortably under the scrutiny. He didn’t feel important. He felt like an imposter—a call center worker with no idea why he’d been yanked out of his ordinary life into whatever this was.

One of the women, her braided hair streaked with gray, leaned forward. “What do you know of the Decay?” she asked.

“Not much,” Ethan admitted. “I… I was attacked by one of those creatures. Lyssara saved me.”

A murmur passed through the council. The woman sighed. “Then you’ve already seen the danger. The Decay grows stronger with each passing day. If you were summoned now, it means the gods see the crisis as dire.”

“The gods?” Ethan repeated. “I don’t even—how am I supposed to help? I don’t have powers, or training, or…” He trailed off, his voice faltering under their stares.

“You will,” Lyssara said firmly, cutting through the tension. “The System will guide him, just as it does all of us.”

Before anyone could respond, the building shook. A distant, guttural roar rumbled through the air, followed by shouts from outside. Everyone froze for a heartbeat, then sprang into motion.

“Decay beasts,” Lyssara growled, already moving toward the door. “Ethan, stay close.”

Ethan’s stomach flipped as he stumbled after her. Outside, the village was chaos. People shouted warnings, grabbing weapons or fleeing to shelter. The guards at the gate had their spears raised, their faces pale but determined.

“They’re here!” one of the guards yelled as another roar echoed, louder this time.

Ethan followed Lyssara to the gate, his heart pounding. Beyond the wooden palisade, movement stirred in the shadows of the forest. Then they emerged.

A pack of Decay beasts—four of them—lumbered into view. They were twisted and grotesque, their blackened fur patchy and clinging to emaciated bodies. Their glowing green eyes fixed on the village, and their snarls were filled with a malevolent hunger.

“Ready the defenses!” Lyssara barked, her voice carrying above the chaos. The villagers scrambled to obey, raising makeshift barricades and readying bows.

Ethan’s legs felt like lead. His mind screamed at him to run, but his feet wouldn’t move. The memory of the creature that had attacked him in the meadow flashed through his mind—its snarling maw, its relentless pursuit. And now there were four of them.

Lyssara grabbed his arm, snapping him out of his stupor. “You want to survive? Then fight.”

“I—I don’t know how,” he stammered.

“You’ll learn.” She thrust a spear into his hands. It was crude, its wooden shaft worn and splintered, but the sharp iron tip gleamed. “Stay behind me and do exactly what I say.”

Ethan nodded numbly, gripping the spear with trembling hands.

The beasts charged.

The first beast reached the gate with terrifying speed. It leapt at one of the guards, who barely managed to deflect its claws with his spear. The force of the impact knocked him back, and the beast lunged again, its jaws snapping.

Lyssara was a blur of motion. Her sword flashed in the sunlight as she slashed downward, severing the beast’s head in one clean strike. She didn’t pause to admire her work, turning immediately to face the next attacker.

“Hold the line!” she shouted, rallying the defenders.

Ethan stayed close behind her, his grip on the spear slick with sweat. Another beast broke through the barricades, its glowing eyes locking onto him. Panic surged through him as it lunged, its claws outstretched. He stumbled back, raising the spear instinctively.

The iron tip sank into the beast’s shoulder, and it let out a pained snarl. But the creature was stronger than Ethan anticipated. It twisted, ripping the spear from his hands and throwing him to the ground.

“Ethan!” Lyssara’s voice cut through the chaos.

The beast loomed over him, its jaws inches from his face. Ethan’s hands scrabbled in the dirt, searching for anything to defend himself. His fingers closed around a rock, and he swung it wildly, striking the beast in the side of the head. It yelped, momentarily stunned.

Before it could recover, an arrow whistled through the air and buried itself in the beast’s neck. It collapsed in a heap, blood pooling beneath it.

Ethan gasped for air, his chest heaving. He looked up to see one of the village archers lowering their bow, giving him a quick nod before turning to fire at another target.

“Get up!” Lyssara shouted, pulling him to his feet. “You’re not done yet.”

The battle raged on. The villagers fought desperately, their makeshift weapons and fragile barricades barely holding against the onslaught. Lyssara was everywhere at once, cutting down beasts with precision and shouting orders to keep the defenders organized.

Ethan tried to keep up, retrieving his spear and stabbing at any creature that got too close. His movements were clumsy and hesitant, but the adrenaline coursing through him dulled his fear.

The last beast, the largest of the pack, broke through the gate with a deafening roar. It was larger than the others, its body twisted and pulsating with sickly green veins. The guards hesitated, their courage wavering.

Lyssara stepped forward, her sword gleaming. “Focus fire on its legs!” she commanded. “Bring it down!”

The archers loosed a volley of arrows, and the beast snarled as the projectiles sank into its thick hide. It charged, its claws tearing through the ground, but Lyssara stood firm. As it lunged, she sidestepped with practiced ease and drove her sword into its side.

“Now, Ethan!” she shouted.

Ethan froze, his mind screaming at him to move but his body locked in place. The beast turned its glowing eyes toward him, its maw opening wide. He could feel its fetid breath, the stench making his stomach churn.

“Ethan!” Lyssara’s voice cut through his paralysis.

With a surge of determination, he lunged forward, driving his spear into the beast’s exposed throat. The iron tip pierced through, and the creature let out a choked snarl before collapsing in a heap.

Silence fell over the battlefield, broken only by the labored breathing of the defenders. The beasts were dead.

Ethan stumbled back, his legs trembling. His hands were slick with blood—whether it was his or the beasts’, he couldn’t tell. He looked around at the carnage, the mangled bodies of the creatures lying among the broken barricades.

Lyssara approached him, her sword dripping with ichor. “You did well,” she said, her voice steady. “Clumsy, but well.”

Ethan let out a shaky laugh. “That’s one way to put it.”

She placed a hand on his shoulder, her expression serious. “You fought. That’s more than most Summoned manage on their first day.”

Ethan nodded, too exhausted to reply. He glanced at the villagers, who were beginning to repair the damage and tend to the wounded. Despite their fear, they carried on, their resolve unshaken.

A soft chime echoed in his mind, and a translucent window appeared before him:

SYSTEM NOTIFICATION
Favor gained: +15 (Merithera)
Reason: Contribution to the defense of Haven’s Reach.

Ethan stared at the screen, the words sinking in. He wasn’t sure what it meant yet, but one thing was clear: this world was unlike anything he’d ever known. And if he wanted to survive, he’d have to keep fighting.
