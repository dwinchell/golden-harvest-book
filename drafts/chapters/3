### Chapter 3: The System and the Scythes

The Decay beasts charged from the treeline, their forms grotesque and twisted. Ethan froze for a heartbeat, gripping the scythe Doran had handed him earlier. The glow in the beasts' eyes was the same sickly green he had seen on the wolf that attacked him in the forest. This time, there were more of them.

"Hold the line!" Doran shouted, stepping forward to join the ragtag group of villagers. They bristled with crude weapons—pitchforks, axes, and farming tools turned makeshift defenses. Fear was etched into their faces, but there was something else, too: a determination born of necessity.

Ethan stood near the back, his heart pounding. He gripped the handle of the scythe tightly, sweat trickling down his temples. The thought of charging into combat made his stomach churn, but the desperate cries of the villagers snapped him out of his paralysis. If he didn’t help, people might die.

The first beast lunged at a man wielding a pitchfork. Ethan watched as the villager narrowly sidestepped, jabbing his weapon into the creature's side. It howled in pain but didn’t stop, its decaying body seemingly impervious to the wound. Another beast darted past the defenders, heading straight for a young woman trying to herd children to safety.

Without thinking, Ethan ran forward. The scythe felt awkward and heavy in his hands, but he swung it with all his strength. The blade caught the beast’s hind legs, and it stumbled, snarling as it turned its glowing eyes toward him.

"Over here!" Ethan yelled, his voice shaking. The beast lunged, and he barely managed to sidestep, slashing again with the scythe. This time, the blade bit deeper, and the creature dissolved into greenish particles that faded into the air.

A notification appeared in the corner of his vision:

**[Essence Gained: 15]**

Ethan blinked, momentarily stunned, but the battle around him didn’t stop. More beasts emerged from the forest, their snarls echoing through the fields. The villagers fought bravely, but they were outnumbered, and their weapons barely slowed the creatures.

Suddenly, a horn sounded from the opposite side of the village. Ethan turned to see a small group of armored figures charging into the fray. Their weapons gleamed in the fading sunlight, and their movements were precise and calculated. The leader, a tall woman wielding a gleaming silver glaive, shouted commands that cut through the chaos.

"Form up! Protect the villagers!" she commanded, her voice firm and authoritative. The defenders rallied around her, their morale visibly lifting.

The woman’s glaive moved in a deadly arc, slicing through two Decay beasts in a single sweep. The green particles dissipated as quickly as they appeared, and Ethan felt a flicker of hope. The newcomers—clearly warriors of some kind—were turning the tide.

Ethan stepped back, letting the professionals take over. His chest heaved as he tried to catch his breath. He glanced around, searching for Doran, and spotted him a few yards away, still fighting alongside the villagers. Relief flooded through Ethan when he saw that Doran was unharmed.

Within minutes, the remaining Decay beasts were defeated. The field was eerily quiet, save for the labored breathing of the villagers and the warriors. The leader of the armored group turned to face the villagers, her glaive resting against the ground.

"Is anyone hurt?" she asked, her tone sharp but concerned.

A few villagers stepped forward, nursing minor wounds. The woman gestured to one of her companions, a shorter man carrying a satchel. He began tending to the injured with practiced efficiency.

Doran approached the woman, his scythe still in hand. "We owe you our lives," he said, his voice steady despite the exhaustion in his eyes. "Thank you for coming when you did."

The woman nodded curtly. "We heard reports of increased Decay activity in the area. This village was one of our priorities. My name is Lyssara, warrior-priestess of Merithera." Her piercing gaze swept over the crowd, landing on Ethan. "You. Step forward."

Ethan’s stomach dropped. He hesitated, but the weight of her stare left him no choice. He stepped forward, gripping the scythe tightly to keep his hands from shaking.

"You fought," Lyssara said, her tone unreadable. It wasn’t a question. Her eyes flicked to the scythe. "And with that, no less."

Ethan swallowed hard. "I… I tried."

Lyssara’s lips twitched, almost forming a smile. "You did more than try. You held your ground. That’s more than I can say for most untrained villagers." She turned to Doran. "Who is he?"

Doran scratched the back of his head. "Ethan… he showed up earlier today. Said he was lost. Doesn’t seem to know much about this place."

Lyssara’s gaze sharpened. "Lost, is he? And yet, he fought. Interesting." She looked back at Ethan. "Come with me."

Ethan’s heart pounded. "What? Why?"

Lyssara didn’t answer, simply turning and walking toward the village square. After a moment’s hesitation, Ethan followed, clutching the scythe tightly.

---

The village square was a simple clearing surrounded by modest wooden buildings. A well stood in the center, its stone edges worn smooth from years of use. Lyssara stopped near the well, turning to face Ethan.

"You’re not from here," she said, her tone leaving no room for denial. "And you’re not just some lost traveler."

Ethan hesitated. How could he explain where he was from without sounding insane? He settled for a half-truth. "I… don’t remember much. I woke up in the forest. I’ve been trying to figure out where I am ever since."

Lyssara studied him, her gaze piercing. "You encountered a Decay wolf in the forest, didn’t you?"

Ethan’s eyes widened. "How did you…?"

"Your movements during the fight," she said. "You’ve fought these creatures before, even if you’re inexperienced. The way you attacked the legs—that’s not something a novice would know instinctively."

Ethan felt a surge of unease. "It wasn’t instinct. I just… got lucky."

Lyssara raised an eyebrow but didn’t press further. "Luck or not, you survived. That means something."

One of her companions approached, a tall man with a bow slung over his shoulder. "The villagers are stable," he said. "No major injuries."

Lyssara nodded. "Good. Keep an eye on the perimeter. I need to speak with our… guest."

The man gave Ethan a curious glance before walking off. Lyssara turned back to him. "Tell me, Ethan. Do you know what a pledge is?"

He shook his head. "Not really."

"A pledge is a commitment—a bond between a mortal and a god," Lyssara explained. "It grants strength and purpose. Without one, most people find it difficult to thrive in this world."

Ethan’s mind raced. "And you… you’ve pledged?"

She lifted her glaive slightly, the sunlight glinting off its blade. "To Merithera, the goddess of the harvest and balance. She grants us the strength to protect those who cannot protect themselves." Her gaze softened slightly. "You fought well today, Ethan. But if you wish to survive—truly survive—you’ll need more than luck."

Ethan hesitated. The idea of pledging to a god felt alien, yet there was something compelling in Lyssara’s words. If this world operated on rules he didn’t understand, maybe this was his chance to find his place in it.

"How do I pledge?" he asked.

Lyssara’s lips curled into a small smile. "First, you must prove yourself. If you’re willing to learn, I’ll teach you. The choice is yours."

Ethan looked down at the scythe in his hands, its blade nicked and dulled from the fight. He thought of the villagers, their fear and courage. He thought of Doran, who had trusted him despite knowing nothing about him.

He looked back at Lyssara and nodded. "I’m willing."

---

That night, as the village settled into an uneasy quiet, Ethan lay on a makeshift bed in Doran’s small home. His body ached from the day’s events, but his mind buzzed with questions. The fight, the notifications, Lyssara’s words… everything felt surreal.

A faint green glow appeared in the corner of his vision, and another notification popped up:

**[Quest Updated: Follow the Path]**

For the first time since arriving in this strange world, Ethan felt a spark of hope. He didn’t know where this path would lead, but for now, he was willing to take the first step.
