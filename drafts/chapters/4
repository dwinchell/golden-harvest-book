Chapter 4: Lyssara’s Reinforcements
The morning sun rose over Haven’s Reach, bathing the village in pale light. The quiet hum of activity filled the air as villagers worked to repair the damage from the previous day’s attack. Barricades were patched, tools sharpened, and the lingering scars of the Decay beasts’ assault were erased as much as possible.

Ethan stood near the well, watching the villagers bustle around him. He felt like an outsider. The events of the previous day replayed in his mind—the snarls of the Decay beasts, the chaos of the battle, and the sharp pang of inadequacy he’d felt holding the awkward spear. His hands were raw and blistered, and his arms still ached from gripping the weapon too tightly.

The sounds of boots on dirt broke through his thoughts. The rhythmic march grew louder, and Ethan turned to see a line of golden-trimmed figures emerging over the horizon. At their head was Lyssara, her stride purposeful and commanding. Behind her marched a contingent of Golden Scythes, their polished armor glinting in the morning light.

The villagers stopped their work, gathering in the square as murmurs of relief and hope spread through the crowd. Ethan moved closer, lingering at the edge as Lyssara reached the center of the square. She raised her hand, and the villagers fell silent.

“Haven’s Reach,” Lyssara began, her voice firm and clear. “Yesterday, you stood against the Decay and defended your home. Your courage and resilience saved this village.”

The crowd murmured their agreement, nodding solemnly. Lyssara’s gaze swept over them, steady and unflinching. “But the Decay does not rest. It spreads faster than anticipated. This village lies at the frontier of its corruption, a key point of defense for the heartlands. If Haven’s Reach falls, the balance tips in its favor.”

She paused, letting her words settle. “Merithera’s Order of the Golden Scythe stands with you. We will strengthen your defenses, guide you, and fight alongside you. Together, we will hold this ground.”

The villagers erupted into cheers, their voices echoing across the square. Ethan couldn’t help but feel a flicker of hope, though it was tempered by the weight of his own inexperience. Lyssara’s presence was commanding, and her confidence was contagious.

When the noise subsided, Lyssara’s sharp gaze landed on Ethan. His stomach churned as she pointed at him. “You,” she said. “Step forward.”

The crowd turned toward Ethan, and he froze. His hands tightened into fists, his palms sweaty. Slowly, he stepped forward, feeling the weight of every pair of eyes on him. Lyssara’s expression was calm but piercing.

“This is Ethan,” she said, addressing the villagers. “A Summoned who stood with you in yesterday’s battle. Though untrained and unprepared, he fought to defend this village. But there is something he has yet to do.”

Ethan’s heart pounded as she continued, “He has yet to pledge.”

A ripple of murmurs spread through the crowd, their voices filled with curiosity and confusion. Lyssara stepped closer to Ethan, her voice quieter but no less firm. “You’ve seen the danger, Ethan. Without a pledge, you are unmoored. The gods grant strength to those who align with their purpose.”

“I didn’t know I needed to,” Ethan said, his voice barely above a whisper.

“Then you know it now,” Lyssara said. She turned to a farmer standing nearby. “You. Do you have a scythe?”

The man blinked, confused. “A… Scythe? You mean one of your—”

“No,” Lyssara interrupted, her tone laced with impatience. “A farming scythe.”

“Oh!” The farmer chuckled nervously and hurried off, returning moments later with a sturdy but worn farming scythe. Its handle was nicked and weathered, and the blade gleamed faintly in the sunlight.

Lyssara took the scythe from him and held it aloft for the crowd to see. “This is more than a tool,” she said. “It is a symbol of Merithera’s balance—of growth and harvest, of life and death. To wield it is to protect that balance.”

She turned back to Ethan, her eyes steady. “Yesterday, you fought without understanding your purpose. Today, you must decide. Will you pledge to Merithera, the goddess of the harvest?”

Ethan hesitated, his thoughts racing. He had never held a scythe before, and the idea of wielding one in battle felt impossible. But something in Lyssara’s words resonated. Protecting people, finding purpose—wasn’t that what he had always wanted?

Slowly, he reached out and took the scythe. Its weight surprised him, heavier than he’d expected, but it felt… right. Lyssara nodded, approval flickering in her gaze.

“Good,” she said. “Your training begins now.”

The rest of the day was a blur of activity. Lyssara wasted no time putting Ethan to work, leading him to a cleared area at the edge of the village where the other Scythes were training the villagers. She handed him the scythe and stood before him, her sharp gaze appraising.

“Show me your stance,” she said.

Ethan hesitated, gripping the scythe awkwardly. He planted his feet and raised the blade, but the movement felt clumsy and unnatural.

“Wrong,” Lyssara said, stepping forward to adjust his hands. Her grip was firm but steady as she guided him. “Relax your shoulders. Keep your knees bent. The scythe isn’t just a weapon—it’s an extension of your body. It moves with you.”

He nodded, trying to mimic her fluid movements. The scythe’s weight felt unwieldy, pulling him off balance with every swing. He stumbled more than once, his frustration mounting.

“Again,” Lyssara said, her tone patient but firm.

Ethan gritted his teeth and tried again. This time, the motion was slightly smoother. He felt the blade cut through the air, though it still lacked precision. Lyssara nodded approvingly.

“Better,” she said. “But you’ll need more practice.”

The hours dragged on, the sun climbing higher as Ethan repeated the same movements over and over. His arms burned, and sweat dripped from his brow, but he kept going. Around him, villagers trained with spears and bows, their determination bolstered by the presence of the Scythes.

By the time the sun dipped below the horizon, Ethan was exhausted. He leaned on the scythe, his arms trembling. Lyssara stood nearby, her expression calm but unreadable.

“You’ve made progress,” she said. “But this is only the beginning.”

Ethan managed a weak smile. “I didn’t expect to be a master in one day.”

“Good,” she said with a faint smirk. “Because tomorrow, we begin again.”

That evening, as the village settled into an uneasy calm, Ethan sat near the well, staring at the scythe resting across his lap. He still didn’t fully understand this world or his place in it, but he felt a flicker of determination. For the first time, he felt like he might be able to contribute—like he might belong.

Lyssara approached, her footsteps light despite her armor. She stopped beside him, her gaze thoughtful. “You did well today,” she said.

“Thanks,” Ethan replied, though he wasn’t sure he believed it.

“You’ll need to pledge soon,” Lyssara said, her tone softer now. “Merithera values resilience and protection. Those who follow her fight for something greater than themselves.”

Ethan nodded, her words lingering in his mind. He didn’t have all the answers yet, but for the first time, he felt a spark of hope.

Maybe, just maybe, he could find his place in this world.
