### Chapter 4: Lyssara’s Reinforcements

The sun crept above the treetops, casting long shadows across the fields surrounding Haven’s Reach. The air was brisk, but the warmth of the rising day hinted at the work to come. The village bore the scars of the Decay beasts’ attack: broken barricades, clawed-up soil, and the wary glances of villagers who knew the danger was far from over.

Ethan stood near the well, his muscles aching from the previous day’s battle. The scythe Lyssara had handed him earlier rested nearby, and he couldn’t help but glance at it every few moments. Its wooden handle was worn smooth from years of use, its blade sharp and gleaming in the early light. It felt like both a burden and a promise—one he wasn’t sure he was ready to bear.

The sound of marching boots pulled Ethan from his thoughts. A wave of murmurs rippled through the villagers as a column of figures emerged from the dirt road that led into the village. At the head of the group was Lyssara, her stride purposeful, her armor gleaming with golden accents that caught the sunlight. Behind her marched a contingent of Scythes, their polished weapons and disciplined steps exuding strength and reassurance.

The villagers gathered quickly, drawn by the sight of reinforcements. Ethan joined the crowd, lingering at the edges as he watched Lyssara approach the center of the square. When she raised her hand, silence fell over the crowd.

“Haven’s Reach,” Lyssara began, her voice clear and commanding. “Yesterday, you faced the Decay and stood your ground. You defended your homes and your families, and because of your courage, this village still stands.”

A murmur of approval swept through the crowd, though the tension in the villagers’ faces didn’t fade entirely. Lyssara’s expression remained resolute as she continued.

“But the Decay does not rest,” she said. “It grows stronger with every passing day, spreading its corruption further into the heartlands. Haven’s Reach lies on the frontier of this battle, a critical line of defense. If this village falls, the balance will tip toward destruction.”

Ethan felt a chill at her words, the weight of her message sinking in. The Decay wasn’t just a local problem—it was a threat to everyone.

“That is why we are here,” Lyssara said, gesturing to the Scythes behind her. “Merithera’s Order of the Golden Scythe answers your call. We will fight alongside you, train you, and guide you. Together, we will protect this village.”

The crowd erupted into cheers, their relief and hope palpable. Ethan couldn’t help but feel a flicker of admiration for Lyssara. She carried herself with a confidence that was infectious, her words sparking a fire in the weary villagers.

When the cheers subsided, Lyssara’s gaze swept the crowd, and then her eyes locked onto Ethan. His stomach twisted as she raised her hand and pointed at him.

“You,” she called. “Step forward.”

The villagers turned to look at him, their expressions curious but not unkind. Ethan hesitated, feeling the weight of their stares pressing down on him. Slowly, he stepped forward, his legs unsteady as he pushed through the crowd until he stood before Lyssara.

“This is Ethan,” Lyssara said, her voice steady as she addressed the villagers. “He is one of the Summoned, brought to this world by the gods to serve a purpose. Yesterday, he fought alongside you to defend this village. Though untrained and unprepared, he stood when others might have fallen.”

Ethan’s cheeks burned as whispers spread through the crowd. He didn’t feel deserving of the praise—he’d barely survived, let alone contributed meaningfully.

“But,” Lyssara continued, her tone sharpening, “he has yet to pledge.”

The murmurs grew louder, and Ethan felt his embarrassment deepen. Lyssara stepped closer to him, her piercing gaze unwavering. “You’ve seen the danger, Ethan. You’ve seen what the Decay can do. Without a pledge, you are unmoored. The gods grant strength to those who align themselves with a purpose.”

“I… didn’t know I had to,” Ethan said, his voice barely audible.

“Then learn it now,” Lyssara said. She turned to one of the farmers standing near the front of the crowd. “Do you have a scythe?”

The man blinked, confused. “A… Scythe? You mean one of your—?”

“No,” Lyssara interrupted, her tone betraying the faintest hint of impatience. “A farming scythe.”

The farmer chuckled nervously, the misunderstanding drawing a few soft laughs from the crowd. He hurried off and returned moments later, carrying a sturdy but well-used scythe. Its wooden handle was nicked and weathered, the blade gleaming faintly in the sunlight.

Lyssara took the scythe and held it aloft for the crowd to see. “This is more than a tool,” she said. “It is a symbol of Merithera’s balance—of growth and harvest, of life and death. To wield it is to protect that balance.”

She turned back to Ethan, her expression firm but not unkind. “Yesterday, you fought without understanding your purpose. Today, you must decide. Will you pledge to Merithera, the goddess of the harvest?”

The square fell silent, all eyes on Ethan. His heart raced, and his thoughts swirled in confusion. He had never held a scythe before, and the idea of wielding one in battle felt impossible. But something about Lyssara’s words resonated. Protecting others, finding purpose—it was something he’d been missing for so long.

Slowly, he reached out and took the scythe from her hands. Its weight surprised him, heavier than he’d expected, but it felt… right. Lyssara nodded, satisfaction flickering in her gaze.

“Good,” she said. “Your training begins now.”

The rest of the day was grueling. Lyssara wasted no time putting Ethan to work, leading him to a cleared area near the edge of the village. She began drilling him on the basics of wielding the scythe. The tool felt awkward and unwieldy in his hands, its weight throwing him off balance with every swing.

“Your grip is wrong,” Lyssara said, stepping forward to adjust his hands. Her touch was firm but steady as she guided him. “Relax your shoulders. Keep your knees bent. The scythe isn’t just a weapon—it’s an extension of your body.”

Ethan nodded, trying to mimic her fluid movements. He swung the scythe again, but the blade scraped the dirt, sending a spray of soil into the air.

“Again,” Lyssara said, her patience unwavering.

Ethan gritted his teeth and tried again. This time, the motion felt slightly smoother, though far from perfect. Lyssara nodded approvingly.

“Better,” she said. “But you’ll need more practice.”

The hours dragged on, the sun climbing higher as Ethan repeated the same movements over and over. His muscles burned, and sweat dripped from his brow, but he kept going. Around him, villagers trained with spears and bows under the guidance of the Scythes, their determination bolstered by the reinforcements.

By the time the sun dipped low in the sky, Ethan was exhausted. He leaned on the scythe, his arms trembling. Lyssara stood nearby, her expression calm but unreadable.

“You’ve made progress,” she said. “But this is only the beginning.”

Ethan managed a weak smile. “I didn’t expect to be a master in one day.”

“Good,” she said with a faint smirk. “Because tomorrow, we begin again.”

That evening, as the village settled into an uneasy calm, Ethan sat near the well, staring at the scythe resting across his lap. He still didn’t fully understand this world or his place in it, but he felt a flicker of determination. For the first time, he felt like he might be able to contribute—like he might belong.

Lyssara approached, her footsteps light despite her armor. She stopped beside him, her gaze thoughtful. “You did well today,” she said.

“Thanks,” Ethan replied, though he wasn’t sure if he believed it.

“You’ll need to pledge soon,” she said, her tone softer now. “Merithera values resilience and protection. Those who follow her fight for something greater than themselves.”

Ethan nodded, her words lingering in his mind. He didn’t have all the answers yet, but for the first time, he felt a spark of hope.

Maybe, just maybe, he could find his place in this world.
