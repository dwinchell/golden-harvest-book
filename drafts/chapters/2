### Chapter 2: A New Reality

#### Part 2.1: The Journey to Haven’s Reach

Ethan stumbled through the forest, his breath catching on the humid air. Each step seemed harder than the last, the uneven ground unforgiving beneath his boots. Lyssara moved ahead of him with effortless grace, her golden armor shining faintly in the dappled sunlight.

“How much farther?” he asked, his voice strained.

“Not far,” Lyssara replied, glancing back briefly. “Try to keep up.”

Ethan grumbled under his breath, feeling the ache in his legs. The weight of the unfamiliar spear slung over his shoulder didn’t help. Despite his fatigue, he couldn’t ignore the tension radiating from Lyssara. Her hand hovered near her scythe, her sharp gaze scanning the trees.

“What’s wrong?” he asked.

“The wilderness near Haven’s Reach isn’t safe,” she said simply. “Stay alert.”

Her words made his skin prickle. The memory of the Decay beast flashed through his mind—its glowing green eyes, twisted form, and the unnatural way it moved.

When the forest finally opened into a clearing, Ethan’s relief was palpable. Ahead, a village sat nestled against the edge of the woods, surrounded by a sturdy wooden palisade. Smoke curled from chimneys, and the sounds of hammering and chatter reached his ears.

“That’s Haven’s Reach,” Lyssara said, her tone steady. “We’ll be safe there, for now.”

#### Part 2.2: Arrival and First Impressions

As they entered the village, the air seemed to shift. Villagers stopped their tasks to watch them pass, their eyes lingering on Ethan’s strange clothes and unsteady gait. Lyssara, by contrast, was greeted with nods and murmured words of respect.

“Are they always this friendly?” Ethan muttered.

“You’re an outsider,” Lyssara said. “They’re wary, but they trust me. That’s enough for now.”

She led him to the largest building in the village, a sturdy structure with wide wooden doors and carvings of a golden scythe on its frame. Inside, the air was warm, smelling faintly of herbs and smoke.

“Sit,” Lyssara said, motioning to a long wooden table.

Ethan obeyed, his body grateful for the rest. Lyssara sat across from him, her expression unreadable.

“You have questions,” she said.

“Plenty,” Ethan replied. “What is this place? What’s the System? Why am I here?”

Lyssara leaned back slightly, her armor clinking. “This is the System World. It’s governed by rules created by the gods, a framework that defines everything from strength to skills to survival. The System tracks your actions and rewards growth, but it doesn’t do the work for you.”

Ethan frowned. “The gods? You’re saying they’re real?”

“They’re very real,” she said firmly. “And powerful. They created the System to harness essence, a kind of energy generated by mortal actions. Essence fuels their power and their domains.”

“So, this ‘System’—it’s like a game?” Ethan asked, struggling to piece things together.

“Not exactly,” Lyssara said. “The stakes here are real, Ethan. And the System doesn’t guarantee success—it only provides the tools. Your survival depends on how you use them.”

#### Part 2.3: The System and Pledging

Lyssara handed Ethan a parchment covered in glowing runes. “Touch this,” she instructed.

Ethan hesitated, then pressed his hand against the parchment. It dissolved into light, and a translucent screen appeared before him.

**[System Notification: Status Unlocked]**
**Name:** Ethan
**Level:** 0
**Class:** None
**Skills:** None
**Alignment:** Undefined

“Level zero? No skills? That’s fantastic,” Ethan muttered, sarcasm thick in his voice.

Lyssara’s lips twitched in the barest hint of a smile. “Everyone starts at zero. The System rewards effort. Fight, grow, and make choices that align with your goals.”

“And this ‘alignment’? What does that mean?” Ethan asked.

“Alignment reflects your values and the god you choose to pledge to,” Lyssara explained. “A pledge is a bond—a commitment to a god’s ideals. In return, you gain access to their blessings, classes, and abilities.”

Ethan leaned back, overwhelmed. “And if I don’t pledge?”

Lyssara’s expression turned serious. “Then you’ll remain weak. The System won’t stop you from surviving, but it won’t make it easy either.”

The weight of her words settled over Ethan like a heavy blanket. He was in a world he didn’t understand, with rules that demanded decisions he wasn’t ready to make.

#### Part 2.4: The Threat of Decay

Ethan’s mind wandered to the creature that had attacked him in the forest. “Those monsters—the Decay beasts—what are they?”

“They’re manifestations of corruption,” Lyssara said, her tone grim. “Decay is tied to Veskara, one of the Zenith gods. It spreads like a disease, infecting life and twisting it into something unnatural.”

“Why are they here?”

“That’s what I’m trying to find out,” Lyssara admitted. “Their presence this far from Decay’s usual territory is troubling. Something is drawing them closer.”

Ethan shivered. The memory of the beast’s glowing green eyes and guttural snarls still haunted him. “Are they everywhere?”

“Not yet,” Lyssara said. “But the attacks have been increasing. That’s why I’m here—to protect Haven’s Reach and uncover the cause.”

Ethan stared at the table, the enormity of the situation weighing on him. He felt like a pawn in a game he didn’t understand, caught between forces far greater than himself.

#### Part 2.5: Life at the Edge

Over the next few days, Ethan tried to find his footing in Haven’s Reach. The villagers were wary of him at first, but his willingness to help earned their cautious approval. He spent hours repairing fences, hauling supplies, and fetching water.

The work was grueling, but it kept his mind off the growing list of questions and fears swirling inside him. Each task brought him face-to-face with the harsh reality of the village’s existence. Life here was hard, but the villagers faced it with quiet determination.

The elder, Garrick, took a particular interest in Ethan. “You’re not from around here,” the old man said one evening as they sat by a fire.

“Not even close,” Ethan replied.

“You’ve got a lot to learn,” Garrick said, his weathered face serious. “But you’re not the first outsider we’ve seen. If you work hard, you’ll find your place.”

Ethan nodded, though he wasn’t sure if Garrick’s words were meant as encouragement or a warning.

Lyssara remained a steady presence, offering guidance when needed. She trained with the villagers, showing them how to hold a weapon, how to defend themselves. Ethan often watched, trying to absorb what he could.

“You’re adapting,” Lyssara said one afternoon as they stood by the edge of the fields.

“Am I?” Ethan asked. “Because it still feels like I have no idea what I’m doing.”

“You are,” Lyssara said firmly. “You’ve been thrown into a difficult situation, but you’re still standing. That’s more than most can say.”

Ethan wanted to believe her, but the shadow of the Decay beasts lingered in his mind. He knew that Haven’s Reach wasn’t as safe as it seemed, and that the true challenges were still ahead.
