**Chapter 2: A New Reality**

**Section 2.1: Survival Instincts**

Ethan’s breath came in shallow bursts as he scanned the shadowed forest around him. The trees, towering and ancient, seemed to lean in closer, their gnarled branches clawing at the sky. Every sound—a rustle of leaves, the snap of a twig—made his pulse quicken. He had no idea where he was or how he had gotten there.

Something moved in the underbrush. Ethan froze, his heart hammering. A low growl rumbled through the air, sending a shiver down his spine. Slowly, he backed away, but the growl followed, growing louder.

From the shadows emerged a creature that seemed to ooze menace. It was a wolf, but its body was wrong—patches of fur were missing, revealing gray, decayed flesh. Its eyes glowed faintly green, and black ichor dripped from its jaws. The stench of rot hit Ethan like a wall.

The creature lunged, and instinct took over. Ethan threw himself to the side, narrowly avoiding the beast’s snapping jaws. He scrambled to his feet, his hands searching the ground for anything he could use as a weapon. His fingers closed around a sturdy branch. As the wolf charged again, he swung wildly, the branch connecting with a sickening crack. The creature yelped but didn’t stop.

A notification flashed before Ethan’s eyes, hovering in the air as though projected on an invisible screen:

> **Basic Combat Skill Unlocked: Improvised Weaponry**

Confusion and fear mixed as the words lingered in his vision, but there was no time to dwell. The wolf leapt again, and Ethan swung harder, landing a blow to its skull. With a final, guttural growl, the creature collapsed, ichor pooling around it. Ethan staggered back, his chest heaving.

Another notification appeared:

> **Victory! Essence Gained: 5**

He stared at the message, trying to make sense of what had just happened. Before he could process it, another noise in the distance snapped him back to reality. He had to keep moving.

**Section 2.2: The Golden Field**

Hours passed as Ethan navigated the forest, his body aching and his mind racing with questions. As dawn broke, the dense trees gave way to open space. He emerged onto a hill overlooking a vast field of golden grain. The sight stopped him in his tracks.

The field seemed to shimmer in the early morning light, the stalks swaying gently in the breeze. It was beautiful—alive, vibrant, and untouched by whatever corruption plagued the wolf he had encountered. Ethan felt a strange warmth fill his chest, a fleeting sense of calm in the chaos.

For the first time since his arrival, he allowed himself to breathe deeply. The air was fresh, carrying the faint scent of wildflowers. He descended the hill, his fingers brushing the tops of the grain. There was something familiar about the scene, something that reminded him of his grandparents’ farm. But this was more than nostalgia. The field felt alive in a way that defied explanation.

**Section 2.3: Reaching the Village**

Following a dirt path that wound through the field, Ethan eventually came to a small wooden signpost. Its weathered surface bore the name "Alder’s Edge," along with an arrow pointing toward a cluster of buildings in the distance.

As he approached, he noticed a pair of guards stationed at the village gate. They eyed him warily, their hands resting on the hilts of crude swords. Ethan raised his hands in what he hoped was a non-threatening gesture.

“Who are you?” one of the guards asked, a woman with sharp eyes and a no-nonsense tone.

“I… I’m lost,” Ethan admitted. “I don’t know how I got here.”

The guards exchanged a glance, then stepped aside. “Stay out of trouble,” the woman said. “And don’t go near the fields alone. Not with the Decay beasts about.”

Decay beasts. The words sent a chill down Ethan’s spine. He nodded quickly and entered the village.

Alder’s Edge was small but bustling. Villagers moved with purpose, some carrying baskets of produce, others reinforcing fences or sharpening tools. Despite the activity, there was an undercurrent of tension, a wariness in their movements. Ethan felt it too.

An elderly woman approached him, her kind eyes studying him with curiosity. “You look half-dead, boy. Come inside and have some water,” she said, gesturing toward a small cottage nearby.

Grateful, Ethan followed her. Inside, she handed him a cup of water and a piece of bread. As he ate, she introduced herself as Serela and began asking gentle questions about his arrival. Ethan told her the truth—or as much of it as he understood. To his relief, she didn’t press further.

“You’ll need to find work if you’re staying,” Serela said. “We’re a small village, and everyone’s got to pull their weight. But for now, rest. You look like you’ve been through hell.”

Ethan nodded, exhaustion overtaking him. As he sank into a chair, he couldn’t shake the feeling that this village—and whatever had brought him here—was just the beginning of something far greater than himself.
