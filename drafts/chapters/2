### Chapter 2: A New Reality

Ethan’s legs wobbled as he stood, gripping the branch like a lifeline. The forest’s silence felt oppressive now, as if the trees were holding their breath, waiting to see what he’d do next. His pulse still thundered in his ears, but his mind refused to slow down, looping through questions that had no immediate answers.

**What just happened? Where am I? Was that a game interface?**

He glanced at the spot where the Decay wolf had dissolved. The glowing green particles were gone, and the ground where the beast had stood showed no sign of its existence. Whatever this place was, it didn’t operate by Earth’s rules.

Another notification shimmered in his peripheral vision:

**[Quest Updated: Survive]**

Ethan frowned. “Thanks for the helpful advice,” he muttered, his voice sounding foreign in the hushed stillness. A bitter chuckle escaped his lips. “Survive. Right. Like I wasn’t planning on that.”

He shoved the branch into the ground and leaned against it for support. The adrenaline was wearing off, leaving his muscles shaky and his mind heavy with exhaustion. He wanted to sit down, maybe even sleep, but the forest felt far too dangerous for rest. The wolf hadn’t been an isolated event—he could feel it in his bones.

Ethan’s gaze swept the clearing, scanning for anything that might help. A path. Shelter. Food. His stomach growled faintly, reminding him of the convenience store sandwich he’d left half-eaten back in his apartment.

“One thing at a time,” he said aloud, his voice steadying him. He couldn’t afford to freeze up. Not here.

The path he found wasn’t a clear one—just a slight parting in the underbrush, marked by trampled grass and faint indentations that might have been footprints. Ethan followed it cautiously, his branch held like a makeshift staff. The glow of sunlight through the canopy was a comfort, but the faint sounds of distant rustling kept his nerves taut.

After about ten minutes of walking, he spotted movement ahead. His first instinct was to hide, but curiosity tugged at him. Crouching behind a bush, he peered through the leaves.

A figure was bent over in a field, their back to him. They were clad in simple, earth-toned clothing that reminded Ethan of the medieval costumes he’d seen at Renaissance fairs. The person—a man, judging by his broad shoulders—was holding a scythe, cutting down tall stalks of golden grain. The rhythmic *swish-thud* of the blade slicing through the stalks was oddly soothing.

Ethan’s stomach growled again, louder this time. The sound made the man stop mid-swing and glance around. Ethan froze, cursing his hunger as the man’s sharp eyes scanned the trees.

“Who’s there?” the man called, his voice rough but not unfriendly. He tightened his grip on the scythe, holding it like a weapon.

Ethan hesitated. **Do I run? Hide? Or just… step out?** After a moment’s deliberation, he pushed himself to his feet and emerged from the bushes, hands raised.

“Whoa, whoa, easy,” Ethan said. “I’m not here to cause trouble.”

The man’s eyes narrowed as he took in Ethan’s strange clothing. “Who are you? And what are you doing sneaking around?”

“I… don’t know, exactly,” Ethan admitted, lowering his hands slowly. “I’m lost. I woke up in the forest, and… well, things have been a little weird.”

The man studied him for a moment longer before lowering the scythe. “Weird’s one word for it,” he muttered. “You look like you’ve had a rough time. Name’s Doran.”

“Ethan,” he replied, relief washing over him. “Thanks for not…, you know, swinging that thing at me.”

Doran snorted. “You’re lucky you don’t look like one of those Decay-blighted monsters. Otherwise, we wouldn’t be chatting right now.”

Ethan’s brow furrowed. “Decay? Is that what that wolf thing was?”

Doran’s expression darkened. “You ran into one of those? Damn. They’ve been getting bolder lately. Used to stick to the edges of the forest, but now they’re attacking farms outright.” He gestured toward the field. “This grain’s all we’ve got left, and even that’s risky to harvest.”

“Sounds like a bigger problem than one guy with a branch can handle,” Ethan said, glancing at his makeshift weapon.

Doran gave him a faint grin. “You’ve got guts showing up out here with nothing but that stick. Maybe you’re braver than you look.”

Ethan shrugged, unsure whether to feel insulted or flattered. “So, uh, where exactly is here? Like, what’s this place called?”

Doran’s brows knitted together. “You hit your head or something? You’re in Alder’s Edge, one of the last farming villages before the wilderness. Beyond that… well, it’s mostly trouble.”

**Alder’s Edge. Last farming village. Trouble.** Ethan’s mind raced, piecing together fragments of what little he knew. It sounded like something out of a fantasy game, but the pain in his legs and the ache in his arms were far too real.

“Listen,” Doran said, breaking his train of thought. “You look half-starved, and I’ve got some work to finish before sundown. If you’re willing to lend a hand, I’ll see about getting you something to eat. Fair deal?”

Ethan’s stomach growled loudly in response. “Fair deal,” he said with a weak smile.

The next few hours were some of the hardest Ethan could remember. Doran handed him a smaller scythe and gave him a quick demonstration, but swinging the tool effectively was harder than it looked. His muscles screamed in protest after just a few cuts, but the thought of food and some semblance of safety kept him going.

As the sun dipped lower, Doran finally called for a break. He handed Ethan a canteen of water and a piece of hard bread. It wasn’t much, but it was the best thing Ethan had tasted in days.

“Not bad for a first-timer,” Doran said, leaning on his scythe. “You’ve got potential, Ethan. Just need to toughen up a bit.”

Ethan chuckled between bites. “Yeah, well, I’ll take that as a compliment.”

Before Doran could reply, a loud horn sounded in the distance. His expression immediately turned grim. “Damn it,” he muttered, gripping his scythe tightly. “That’s the warning signal. Decay beasts.”

Ethan’s heart sank. “More of those things? How many?”

“No way to know until they show up,” Doran said, already moving toward the edge of the field. “Come on. We’ll need every hand we can get.”

Ethan followed, the weight of the scythe in his hands suddenly feeling much heavier. The reality of this world was setting in fast, and he wasn’t sure he was ready for it. But there was no turning back now.

As they approached the village, Ethan caught sight of a group of villagers armed with pitchforks, axes, and other improvised weapons. They looked nervous but determined, their eyes scanning the treeline for any sign of movement.

“Stick close to me,” Doran said, his voice low. “And if you see one of those things, aim for its legs. Slow it down.”

Ethan nodded, gripping his scythe tightly. He wasn’t sure how much help he’d be, but he’d made a deal—and right now, survival depended on keeping it.

The first howl pierced the air, sending a shiver down Ethan’s spine. The treeline rustled, and the Decay beasts emerged, their glowing eyes fixed on the village. Ethan swallowed hard and raised his weapon, ready for the fight of his life.
