Chapter 2: A New Reality
Ethan trudged behind the armored woman, the strange meadow stretching endlessly around them. The sky, painted in otherworldly hues of violet and gold, shimmered as though it had been brushed by the hand of a god. Yet, for all its beauty, it felt alien and oppressive, a constant reminder that this wasn’t Earth.

The weight of the rock he still clutched dug into his palm. He couldn’t bring himself to let it go, though he knew it was laughable protection against whatever else might be lurking out here. He glanced at the woman walking ahead. She moved with practiced ease, her armor barely making a sound despite the thick plates and chainmail. The sword at her hip and the bow slung across her back were clearly well-used. She was dangerous—Ethan didn’t need any special powers to see that.

“Who are you?” Ethan asked, his voice breaking the uneasy silence.

The woman didn’t stop or turn to look at him. “Lyssara,” she said simply. “Golden Scythe of Merithera.”

Ethan blinked. That wasn’t a title he’d heard before. “And… what is that?”

Now she did stop, turning to face him with a mixture of annoyance and pity. Her sharp features caught the light, making her look both beautiful and intimidating. “A protector. A warrior-priestess. Someone who doesn’t have time to explain the obvious.”

Ethan opened his mouth to argue but thought better of it. Instead, he muttered, “Okay, fine. And what about me? What am I doing here?”

She studied him for a long moment, her piercing eyes scanning him as if searching for something hidden. “You’re one of the Summoned,” she said at last. “You don’t know it yet, but you’ve been chosen. Brought here by a god to serve a purpose.”

“A god?” Ethan’s voice rose in disbelief. “I don’t even—what does that mean? Chosen for what?”

Lyssara sighed and resumed walking, motioning for him to follow. “That’s for you to figure out. The System works in mysterious ways.”

“The System,” Ethan repeated, shaking his head. “You mean the… the thing that showed me that screen?”

“That’s right,” she said without breaking stride. “It tracks your progress, gives you abilities, and ensures you can contribute. Think of it as the thread tying everything together in this world.”

Ethan’s mind raced as he tried to make sense of her words. It sounded like something out of a game, but this wasn’t a game. The pain he’d felt earlier when falling into the creek, the sharp edges of the rock in his hand—this was real. Too real.

“So, what do I do now?” he asked.

Lyssara glanced back at him, her expression hard. “You survive.”

The terrain began to change as they walked, the meadow giving way to a dirt path lined with small stones. Ethan’s legs ached, unused to so much walking, but Lyssara pressed on without hesitation. In the distance, he saw smoke rising in thin trails against the colorful sky. As they crested a hill, a village came into view.

Haven’s Reach was smaller than Ethan had expected. The wooden and stone buildings clustered together like a patchwork quilt, their weathered exteriors suggesting a history of endurance. People moved through the streets, some carrying baskets of goods while others repaired rooftops or mended fences. Despite the hum of activity, there was a sense of tension hanging over the settlement, a quiet wariness that kept everyone’s movements sharp and purposeful.

Lyssara stopped at the edge of the village, her eyes scanning the surroundings. “Stay close,” she said. “This isn’t the safest place, but it’s better than out there.”

Ethan followed her past a wooden gate where two guards stood watch. Their spears were sharp but worn, much like their expressions. One of them nodded at Lyssara.

“Back already?” the guard asked, his tone a mix of surprise and relief.

“Ran into trouble,” Lyssara said, jerking her head toward Ethan. “This one got himself caught by a Decay beast.”

The guards’ eyes flicked to Ethan, and one of them smirked. “First time outside, huh?”

Ethan felt a flush creep up his neck but said nothing. He wasn’t about to admit how terrified he’d been—or how useless.

“Is he a Summoned?” the other guard asked.

Lyssara nodded. “Found him wandering in the meadow. He’s new.”

The guards exchanged a look before stepping aside to let them through. Ethan couldn’t shake the feeling that he’d just been sized up and found lacking.

Inside the village, the tension Ethan had sensed from a distance was even more palpable. People moved quickly, their eyes darting toward the horizon as if expecting trouble. Children played in the dirt, but even their laughter was subdued, and the adults kept them close.

“What’s going on here?” Ethan asked, glancing around.

Lyssara didn’t answer immediately. She led him to a small clearing near the center of the village, where a stone well stood surrounded by wooden benches. She gestured for him to sit, then crossed her arms.

“This village has been under attack,” she said bluntly. “Decay beasts have been growing bolder, hitting settlements closer and closer to the heartlands. Haven’s Reach is on the edge of those lands.”

Ethan felt a chill. He thought back to the creature that had chased him in the meadow, its glowing eyes and snarling maw. The idea of more of them—stronger ones—attacking people made his stomach churn.

“Why?” he asked. “Why are they attacking?”

“That’s what we’re trying to figure out,” Lyssara said. “Decay is a blight, a corruption that spreads when the balance is disturbed. Something—or someone—is pushing it.”

Ethan swallowed hard. This wasn’t the kind of problem he was equipped to deal with. He was just an ordinary guy, stuck in a world he didn’t understand. But the way Lyssara spoke, it was clear she expected him to play some role in this.

“Why me?” he blurted. “Why was I… summoned, or whatever you called it? I’m not a fighter. I’m not even good at my job back home. How am I supposed to help with any of this?”

Lyssara’s expression softened slightly, though her tone remained firm. “The gods don’t make mistakes,” she said. “If you’re here, it’s because you have something this world needs. You just don’t know it yet.”

Ethan wanted to argue, but the weight of her words silenced him. He looked around the village, taking in the determined faces of the people working to keep their homes intact. They didn’t have a choice but to fight for their survival. Maybe he didn’t either.

As the sun dipped lower in the sky, Lyssara left Ethan near the well, saying she needed to report to the village council. He sat on one of the benches, his thoughts racing. The bread he’d eaten earlier—provided by a kind villager who saw his awkward desperation—had dulled his hunger, but his mind remained restless.

What did it mean to be summoned? Who was this god Lyssara had mentioned—Merithera? And how could he, a call center employee with no special skills, possibly help in a world filled with monsters?

A soft chime interrupted his thoughts, and another translucent screen appeared before him:

SYSTEM NOTIFICATION
Favor gained: +5 (Merithera)
Reason: Gratitude shown to a generous villager.

Ethan stared at the words, his heart pounding. Favor? Was this some kind of score? He swiped at the notification, and it disappeared with a faint shimmer.

Before he could process what it meant, Lyssara returned, her expression grim.

“The council wants to see you,” she said.

Ethan tensed. “Me? Why?”

“They need to know what you are and why you’re here,” she said simply. “Come on.”

She offered no further explanation, and Ethan had no choice but to follow her. As they walked toward a larger building near the village center, he felt a knot tighten in his stomach.

This world, with its strange rules and hidden dangers, was nothing like the life he’d known. But as he stepped through the council’s doors, one thing became clear:

There was no going back.
