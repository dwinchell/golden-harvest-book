The glowing eyes hovered in the darkness, unblinking and fixed on Ethan. His breath hitched as the creature stepped into view, its form dragging itself from the shadows like a nightmare made real.

It was a wolf—or something that had once been a wolf. Its fur was patchy and matted, revealing rotting flesh beneath. Bones jutted out at unnatural angles, and black ichor dripped from its open wounds, sizzling faintly as it hit the ground. The stench of decay hit Ethan like a wave, forcing him to swallow back a surge of bile.

The wolf’s movements were jerky, as though it were a puppet pulled by invisible strings. Its glowing eyes locked onto Ethan, burning with unnatural intensity. A deep, guttural growl rose from its throat, sending a shiver down his spine.

Then, a system notification flashed in front of him:

Decaying Wolf (Lv. 1) detected. Threat Level: Moderate.

Ethan’s eyes widened, the words blurring as panic surged through him. His grip on the branch tightened, the rough bark digging into his palms. “What the hell is this thing?” he muttered, his voice shaking.

The wolf took a slow step forward, its claws scraping against the brittle ground. It snarled, baring jagged teeth stained with black ooze. Ethan’s body tensed, his instincts screaming at him to run, but his legs refused to move.

Another notification appeared:

Combat Engaged. Survival Instinct Activated. Temporary Buff: +5 Agility.

“What—?” Ethan barely had time to process the words before the wolf lunged, its decayed body springing forward with terrifying speed.

He swung the branch in a wide arc, the makeshift weapon connecting with the wolf’s side with a sickening crack. The creature yelped, its body twisting midair as it crashed to the ground. But it wasn’t done. It scrambled to its feet, shaking off the hit as though it were nothing.

Ethan staggered back, his heart pounding as the wolf snarled and circled him, its glowing eyes never leaving his face.

“Stay back!” Ethan shouted, his voice trembling. He raised the branch again, his hands slick with sweat. The wolf crouched, muscles tensing for another leap.

And then it pounced.
