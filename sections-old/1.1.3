Ethan took a cautious step forward, his eyes darting to every shadow as though the forest itself might attack. His hands clenched into fists, though he wasn’t sure what good they’d do if something came at him. He hadn’t seen any signs of life, but the oppressive silence felt… predatory. Like something was waiting.

Then, suddenly, his vision flickered.

“What the—?” He staggered back, blinking rapidly as a glowing rectangle of text appeared in front of him, suspended in midair.

You have been summoned. Initializing System Interface...

“What is this?” Ethan whispered, swiping at the air instinctively. The text hovered, unaffected, as though it were part of his field of vision. He turned his head to the side, but it stayed firmly in place, glowing faintly against the muted forest backdrop.

The word “summoned” sent a shiver down his spine. Summoned? Like magic? His thoughts raced, trying to make sense of the situation. This wasn’t a hallucination—at least, he didn’t think it was. The text looked real. Tangible, even.

A second notification blinked into view.

System Initialized. Basic Functions Active. Temporary Buff Applied: +5 Perception.

“What the hell does that mean?” Ethan muttered. His voice cracked as panic clawed its way up his throat. Buff? Perception? This wasn’t just text—it was some kind of… system, like in a video game.

He reached out again, his hand passing uselessly through the floating words. They dissolved into shimmering motes of light before reforming instantly. The unnatural glow cast faint shadows on his face, making the whole thing feel uncomfortably real.

The messages faded after a moment, leaving the air empty again. But the tension in Ethan’s chest didn’t go away. He couldn’t shake the feeling that something—or someone—was watching him.

“Summoned,” he repeated under his breath, his hands balling into fists. He glanced back at the empty forest, his heart pounding in his ears. “Summoned by who? And for what?”
