Ethan took another step forward, his breath shallow and quick. His eyes scanned the dark forest, the warped, skeletal trees seeming to lean inward as if they were closing around him. The faint glow of the system notifications still lingered in his mind, but the silence around him was even more pressing. It was too quiet—unnaturally so.

His foot hit something hard, and he looked down to see a jagged rock poking out of the ashen soil. The thought of using it as a weapon crossed his mind, but he hesitated, a chill running up his spine. He didn’t know what he was preparing for, but his instincts screamed danger.

Then he heard it—a faint, low growl, just loud enough to cut through the silence.

Ethan froze. His head snapped toward the sound, his pulse hammering in his chest. The growl came again, a guttural rumble that seemed to vibrate through the brittle trees. It was close.

“Hello?” he called out, his voice cracking. The sound of his own words startled him—they felt out of place in this quiet, lifeless place.

No response. Just another growl, this time followed by the crunch of dry leaves.

Ethan’s breath caught as his eyes darted to the forest floor. Something had moved—a flash of shadow slipping between the trees. He reached down and grabbed a sturdy branch, its rough bark scratching his palms. It wasn’t much, but it was all he had.

The growling stopped, replaced by silence so thick it pressed on his ears. Ethan clutched the branch tighter, his knuckles whitening. His eyes darted to every shadow, every flicker of movement among the twisted trees. The quiet was worse than the growling. It meant something was waiting.

“Stay calm,” he muttered, his voice barely audible. “Stay calm and—”

A sudden rustle to his left cut him off. Ethan spun, raising the branch like a bat. His heart pounded so loudly it felt like the sound might give him away. Whatever was out there, it wasn’t showing itself yet.

The growl came again, this time from behind him. Slowly, Ethan turned, his grip on the branch tightening as his muscles coiled, ready to swing at the first sign of movement.

And then, from the shadows, two glowing eyes appeared.
