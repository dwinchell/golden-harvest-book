With a bone-jarring thud, the sensation stopped. Ethan slammed onto cold, hard ground, his breath knocked from his lungs. Dazed, he blinked at the canopy of blackened trees above him, their twisted branches clawing at the dim, overcast sky. He groaned, rolling onto his side, and pressed a hand to the sharp ache in his ribs.

The air was thick and acrid, carrying a faint, metallic tang that burned his nose. The ground beneath him was damp and uneven, scattered with patches of brittle, lifeless grass. Slowly, Ethan pushed himself upright, his limbs trembling as if they had forgotten how to support him.

“What… what the hell just happened?” he muttered, his voice hoarse.

The forest around him was unnervingly silent—no rustling leaves, no chirping birds, not even the hum of distant insects. Just silence. It pressed in on him like a physical weight, amplifying the sound of his ragged breathing and the pounding of his heart.

Ethan tried to steady himself, his pulse racing as he turned in place, taking in the alien landscape. Nothing here was familiar. Wherever he was, it wasn’t Earth.

And for the first time, he realized, he was utterly alone.
