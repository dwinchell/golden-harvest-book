The Decaying Wolf lunged, its rotting jaws snapping inches from Ethan’s face. He swung the branch wildly, the impact landing with a solid thwack against the creature’s side. It yelped but didn’t stop, its claws raking the air as it twisted mid-leap, trying to regain its footing.

Ethan stumbled back, nearly losing his grip on the branch. His chest heaved with ragged breaths, his pulse hammering in his ears. The wolf turned on him again, its glowing eyes locked onto him with a cold, predatory hunger. Black ichor dripped from its mouth, sizzling as it hit the ground.

“Not good, not good,” Ethan muttered under his breath, raising the branch like a shield. His hands shook, the weight of his fear making it hard to hold steady.

The wolf crouched, its muscles coiling like a spring. It growled low and deep, the sound vibrating through Ethan’s bones. He could see the tension in its body, the way its claws dug into the brittle earth, preparing for the next attack.

A notification flashed in the corner of his vision:

Critical Threat Detected. Temporary Buff: +5 Strength.

Ethan’s eyes flicked to the glowing text, his mind reeling. “Great. Buffs. Like that’s going to save me.”

The wolf pounced again, faster this time. Ethan barely had a moment to react. He swung the branch with everything he had, the makeshift weapon colliding with the wolf’s skull. The impact sent a jolt up his arms, and the branch splintered under the force.

The wolf hit the ground hard, snarling as it skidded to a stop. It shook its head, black ichor oozing from the wound, but it didn’t stay down for long. It rose, snarling louder than before, its glowing eyes blazing with fury.

Ethan’s grip on the broken branch tightened. He backed away, his mind racing as he searched for anything—anything—that could help. But there was nothing. Just him, the wolf, and the oppressive silence of the forest.

The creature lunged again.
