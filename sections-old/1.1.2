The trees loomed tall and skeletal, their bark blackened and cracked like old charcoal. What few leaves clung to the branches were a sickly yellow-green, shriveled and barely alive. The ground was uneven, a patchwork of brittle grass, exposed roots, and patches of gray, ashen soil. Everything felt… wrong.

Ethan frowned, squatting to touch the dirt. It crumbled between his fingers like sand, leaving a faint residue on his skin. A bitter smell lingered in the air, faint but unmistakable, like rusting metal or spoiled meat.

“Where am I?” he whispered, his voice trembling.

He straightened and looked around again, turning in a slow circle. The forest stretched in every direction, endless and oppressive, with no landmarks to guide him. The canopy above was dense, letting in only a dim, grayish light that made everything feel muted and lifeless.

And the silence—it was suffocating. No birds, no wind, not even the hum of insects. Only the sound of his own breath and the soft crunch of dead leaves underfoot. It wasn’t just quiet; it was wrong, unnatural.

The hair on the back of Ethan’s neck stood on end. He had no idea how he got here, and the forest wasn’t giving him any answers. His instincts screamed at him to leave, but there was nowhere to go.

“Okay, think,” he muttered, running a hand through his hair. “Stay calm. Figure this out.”

But deep down, he knew there was nothing calm about this place—and nothing about it he could figure out.
