Dillon wants his Portal RPGLit book to uphold feminist values while not being an overtly feminist narrative. He plans to: 1. Write complex, well-rounded female characters, avoiding stereotypes and showing strength in many forms. 2. Create equal relationships based on partnership and mutual respect, including Lyssara's evolving relationship with Ethan. 3. Explore power dynamics thoughtfully, particularly through the concept of pledging and cultural diversity within the world. 4. Subvert tropes, avoiding clich√©s like 'damsel in distress' and showing female characters in diverse roles such as villains, mentors, and allies. 5. Show feminist values through actions, such as equality in the system, and highlight the downsides of inequality subtly through story events. 6. Let feminist values exist naturally in the world, with norms of equality in some societies and organic representation of respect and empowerment. These elements will be integrated into character interactions, worldbuilding, and plot developments.
