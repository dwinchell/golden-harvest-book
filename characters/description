Protagonist: Ethan
Ethan is the central character through whom the story unfolds. A newcomer to the System-based world, he struggles with his sense of identity and purpose. His journey is one of growth, as he evolves from an untrained and hesitant outsider into a confident leader and Harvester blessed by Merithera. Ethan’s role centers on exploring the world, forming key relationships, and driving the story's moral and thematic heart.

Deuteragonist: Lyssara
Lyssara, a warrior-priestess of Merithera, serves as Ethan’s mentor and later his equal. She embodies strength, leadership, and devotion, guiding Ethan while tackling her own challenges. As the deuteragonist, she complements Ethan’s growth with her experience and acts as a moral anchor. Her dynamic evolution from a mentor to a partner highlights the story’s themes of balance, trust, and shared purpose.

Tertiary Characters: Kaelen and Seris
Kaelen: A rogue aligned with Nyssara, Kaelen is a resourceful and cunning figure who brings a pragmatic edge to the party. His role adds tension and complexity, as his alignment with a different god creates moments of conflict and intrigue within the group. Kaelen’s perspective challenges the party to consider broader viewpoints.
Seris: A healer aligned with Elyndra, Seris represents compassion, wisdom, and calm under pressure. Her role balances the intensity of the group dynamics, offering emotional and spiritual insight. Seris also serves as a foil to Lyssara’s more driven and combative nature.
Primary Antagonist: Arceon
Arceon, the God of Ascension and leader of the Zenith, is the story's overarching villain. His ambition and manipulation drive the broader conflict between the Covenant and the Zenith. Working behind the scenes, he uses his secondary antagonists to destabilize Covenant territories and build his power. Arceon represents the story’s core theme of unchecked ambition versus balanced growth.

Secondary Antagonists: Veyara and Drakthar
Veyara: A High Priestess of Thaldris, the God of Greed, Veyara is cunning, manipulative, and driven by selfish ambition. Her schemes directly threaten the protagonists, especially in Acts I and II, where she weaponizes Decay to destabilize Covenant territories. Veyara’s role highlights the dangers of division and greed.
Drakthar: A Zenith-blessed warlord, Drakthar embodies destructive ambition and brute force. As the primary active antagonist in Act III, he poses a direct physical and strategic challenge to Ethan and Lyssara, culminating in a climactic showdown.
Merithera: Supporting Ally
Merithera, the goddess of the harvest, is the benevolent force guiding the protagonists. Working subtly behind the scenes, she steers Ethan’s journey and aids the party through her blessings and influence. Her role emphasizes themes of growth, balance, and the importance of community, serving as the counterpoint to Arceon’s destructive ambition.

Each character’s role is designed to drive the plot, explore the world’s themes, and create compelling interpersonal dynamics.
