Harvester’s Path
Act 1: The Call to Harvest
Chapter 1: The Weight of an Empty Life
Scene 1: Ethan’s Struggles at Work

The flickering fluorescent lights buzzed overhead, casting a harsh, pale glow across the cramped office. Rows of desks filled the open space, each stacked with clutter—coffee-stained papers, tangled cables, and monitors that seemed one error message away from breaking down entirely. Ethan sat at the farthest desk, his chair squeaking faintly as he leaned forward, staring at the spreadsheet on his screen.

His eyes scanned the rows of numbers, catching yet another mistake he hadn’t noticed before. He sighed, the tension in his chest tightening with every passing second. Fixing the error would only take a moment, but he knew the real challenge lay ahead. Submitting the report meant facing Mr. Grayson.

As if on cue, the sound of shoes clicking sharply against the tile floor broke through the muffled typing and quiet chatter around him. Ethan glanced up just as Grayson, the office manager, stepped out of his glass-walled office, a stack of papers in hand and a frown etched deep into his face.

“Ethan!” Grayson’s voice carried easily across the room, slicing through the ambient noise like a blade.

Ethan froze. Every head in the office turned toward him.

“Yes, sir?” he said, forcing himself to meet the man’s gaze.

Grayson held up a report, shaking it slightly for emphasis. “Care to explain why this is incomplete? The client is expecting this tonight, and you’ve wasted hours fumbling around with it.”

Heat rose to Ethan’s face. “I—I found an error,” he stammered. “I’m fixing it now. It’ll be ready in five minutes.”

“Five minutes too late,” Grayson snapped, stepping closer. His eyes narrowed as he looked down at Ethan’s desk, as if the clutter there confirmed his every suspicion. “This isn’t amateur hour, Ethan. Do you know how many people would kill for this job? People who wouldn’t waste my time or the company’s?”

“I’m sorry,” Ethan muttered, keeping his voice low.

“Sorry doesn’t cut it,” Grayson said, his tone sharper now. “I don’t have time to clean up after you. If you can’t handle this, maybe you’re in the wrong place.”

Satisfied with the dressing down, Grayson spun on his heel and strode back to his office. Ethan stared at his screen, his hands trembling slightly as he tried to focus on the corrections. Around him, the muted sounds of typing resumed, but he could still feel the weight of his coworkers’ stares.

Across the room, a burst of laughter broke the tense silence. Two coworkers, Jen and Matt, leaned against a desk, talking animatedly.

“So, we’re all set for Saturday?” Jen asked, grinning. “Clyde’s at seven. Trivia night.”

“Absolutely,” Matt replied. “You better bring your A-game this time.”

“Ha, you wish. I’m taking you down.”

Ethan listened without meaning to. Their voices were warm, friendly, so completely separate from the coldness that surrounded his own desk. He’d never been invited to join them. It wasn’t that they were cruel—they probably didn’t even think about him at all.

He finished the report and sent it off, attaching it to a brief email with the subject line, “Corrected File.” No need for pleasantries; Grayson wouldn’t read them anyway.

As he stood to grab his coat, he glanced toward Grayson’s office. The manager stood by his desk now, chatting with a favored employee, his face lit up with a rare smile. He clapped the man on the shoulder, a clear sign of approval.

Ethan turned away, the tightness in his chest growing heavier. The entire office revolved around Grayson’s moods—his whims and favoritism dictating who thrived and who endured. There was no fairness, no balance. Only power.

On his way out, Ethan passed Jen and Matt, who barely noticed him. Their laughter followed him to the elevator, each chuckle a reminder of his place in the world.

Out on the street, the cold air bit at his cheeks as he pulled his coat tighter around himself. The city stretched around him, towering buildings and busy streets alive with light and sound. He tilted his head back, staring up at the skyscrapers. Their reflective surfaces caught the neon glow of signs and traffic lights, but to Ethan, they looked empty—soulless monuments to the same imbalance he faced at work.

*There has to be more than this,* he thought, the words lingering like a quiet prayer. But the city gave no answer, its hum continuing as if he wasn’t even there.

Scene 2: A Toxic Phone Call
The cold air bit at Ethan’s face as he stepped out of the office building, pulling his coat tighter around him. The streetlights buzzed faintly, their yellow glow spilling over cracked sidewalks. Cars roared past, their headlights cutting through the dark like fleeting beacons. He walked briskly, his breath forming small clouds in the air, eager to escape the day’s suffocating weight.
As he turned a corner, his phone vibrated in his pocket. He pulled it out, the screen lighting up with a familiar name: Mom. Below her name was an old photo—her smiling brightly on a summer afternoon, taken years ago when the distance between them felt smaller.
Ethan stared at the screen, his thumb hovering over the “decline” button. He knew what the call would bring. He always did. But declining wasn’t really an option; it would only lead to more calls and harsher words later. With a resigned sigh, he pressed “accept.”
“Hi, Mom.”
“Well, it’s about time,” she said, her tone overly cheerful but edged with reproach. “I’ve been trying to call you for days.”
“I’ve been busy,” Ethan replied, keeping his voice neutral as he navigated the uneven sidewalk.
“Busy? Too busy for your family?” she said, her voice sharpening. “You know, Ethan, I’m starting to feel like you only call when you need something.”
He swallowed hard, already regretting answering. “What’s going on?” he asked, trying to steer the conversation.
She sighed theatrically, the kind of sigh meant to convey just how much she’d endured. “Your father’s disability check barely covers anything anymore. The bills are piling up, and we’re stretched thin, Ethan. We need a little help.”
“I just sent you money last month,” he said carefully, his chest tightening.
“And it helped, but it wasn’t enough,” she countered, her tone sweetening in a way that made his stomach churn. “Ethan, you know we’ve always done so much for you. Your father and I sacrificed so much to get you through college. You wouldn’t be where you are today without us.”
He clenched his jaw, his grip tightening around the phone. “I’m barely making ends meet myself. I can’t just—”
“Don’t start with the excuses,” she interrupted, her voice losing its feigned warmth. “What do you even spend your money on? You’re not married, you don’t have kids. You can’t tell me you can’t spare something for your family.”
Ethan stopped walking, standing beneath the flickering glow of a neon sign. The words stung, not because they were true, but because they struck at his deepest fears—that he was failing, that his life wasn’t enough.
“I’m trying,” he said softly, though the words felt hollow.
Another sigh. “Fine. I guess we’ll figure it out on our own. Don’t worry about us. We’ll manage somehow.”
The guilt came crashing down like a wave. “I’ll send what I can,” he said, the words tasting bitter as they left his mouth.
Her tone brightened instantly. “Thank you, Ethan. I knew you’d do the right thing. Love you.”
“Yeah. Love you too,” he muttered, ending the call before she could say anything else.
He stood there for a moment, staring at the phone in his hand. The photo of her smiling face lingered on the screen before fading to black. His reflection stared back at him—a pale, exhausted man surrounded by the cold glow of the city.
Shoving the phone back into his pocket, he started walking again, his steps heavier now. The city felt sharper, colder, more unfeeling. His breath came out in uneven puffs, matching the churn of his thoughts.
For years, he’d justified these calls, this dynamic. They were family, after all. But tonight, a small voice whispered a question he couldn’t ignore: Is this really how it has to be?
Scene 3: Home to an Empty Room
Ethan pushed open the door to the apartment, the hinges creaking in protest. The familiar smell of stale air and cold takeout hit him immediately. The living room lights were off, but the room was lit by the flicker of the TV, which blared loudly enough to rattle the thin walls.
“Hey,” Ethan called out as he stepped inside, his voice barely rising above the sound of explosions on the screen.
Jared, his roommate, was sprawled on the couch, a half-eaten box of greasy pizza balanced precariously on his stomach. His eyes remained fixed on the TV, where a gunfight played out in lurid, high-definition chaos.
“Hey,” Ethan said again, louder this time.
Jared waved a hand vaguely in acknowledgment without looking away. “Yeah, hey,” he mumbled, stuffing another slice of pizza into his mouth.
Ethan sighed, slipping off his coat and draping it over the back of a chair. The apartment was as messy as ever—discarded takeout containers littered the coffee table, empty soda cans lined the windowsill, and the kitchen sink overflowed with dirty dishes. Jared had promised to clean up last week, but it was obvious he hadn’t even tried.
Making his way to the kitchen, Ethan stepped over an empty cardboard box and pulled open the freezer. Inside were a few frozen meals and a bag of half-used vegetables. He grabbed the last burrito and unwrapped it, glancing over at the fridge.
A stack of unpaid bills was pinned haphazardly to the door with a magnet advertising a plumber’s services. The bright red “PAST DUE” stamped across the top of one envelope stared back at him, a grim reminder of how tight things were.
The microwave hummed to life, filling the silence between the bursts of gunfire from the TV. Ethan leaned against the counter, rubbing his temples.
“Good day at work?” he asked, trying to strike up some semblance of conversation.
Jared grunted. “Same old.”
Ethan waited for him to elaborate, but Jared didn’t. He just reached for his soda, slurped noisily, and set the can back down on the coffee table without a second glance.
The microwave beeped, signaling the burrito was ready. Ethan grabbed it, wincing as the hot wrapper burned his fingers, and retreated to his room without another word.
The door clicked shut behind him, muffling the TV’s noise but not silencing it entirely. His room was small, barely large enough for the twin bed, rickety desk, and dresser it contained. The only personal touch was the framed photo of his grandparents’ farm sitting on the windowsill, its colors faded from years of sunlight.
Ethan set the burrito on the desk, though he had no appetite. He stared at the photo instead. The red barn stood against a backdrop of rolling golden fields, the kind that seemed to stretch on forever. He could almost hear the soft rustle of wheat in the breeze and the creak of his grandmother’s rocking chair on the porch.
That farm had been more than a place—it had been a life, one built on connection and balance. His grandparents had always seemed so in tune with each other, with the land, with the world around them.
Ethan glanced around his room, the sharp contrast between those memories and his current reality hitting him like a gut punch. The apartment felt lifeless, just a collection of walls that barely contained the chaos spilling out of the living room.
He sighed and sat on the edge of the bed, running a hand through his hair. His thoughts drifted to the farm again, to the warmth and purpose it had represented.
How did I end up here? he wondered. Is this really all there is?
The muffled sound of Jared laughing at something on TV brought him back to the present. Ethan shook his head, grabbed the burrito, and took a small bite. The taste was bland, like cardboard, but he forced it down anyway.
He set the burrito aside after a few bites and leaned back against the wall, staring at the ceiling. His eyes flicked back to the photo on the windowsill, and for a moment, the tiniest spark of longing flickered in his chest.
There has to be more than this, he thought, but the thought felt fragile, almost impossible.
The TV roared again, drowning out the silence. Ethan closed his eyes, letting the exhaustion of the day drag him down.
Scene 4: A Glimpse of Longing
Ethan sat by the window, staring out at the sprawling city. The skyline, with its jagged buildings and harsh neon signs, felt like a vast, uncaring machine. The faint hum of cars and distant sirens filled the air, a soundtrack to his isolation.
His eyes drifted upward, searching for stars, but the sky was polluted, its darkness marred by the glow of the city below. Only one star flickered faintly on the horizon, its light trembling against the void. He focused on it, his mind wandering.
Memories of the farm surfaced unbidden—the golden fields of wheat swaying in the breeze, the creak of his grandmother’s rocking chair on the porch, the warm scent of bread baking in the kitchen. He could almost feel the sun on his face, hear the soft rustle of the fields.
That life had felt whole, harmonious. A stark contrast to the chaos and emptiness he now faced. He glanced at the photo of the farm on the windowsill, its edges worn from years of handling.
How did I end up here? The thought came quietly, almost a whisper. The weight of his day—his boss’s sharp words, his mother’s manipulations, the empty apartment—pressed down on him.
He looked back at the lone star, its faint glow unwavering despite the surrounding gloom. For the briefest moment, he allowed himself to hope.
Please, he thought, his chest tightening. Let something change.
The star twinkled once before a passing cloud swallowed it whole. Ethan sat there a moment longer before retreating to his bed, his heart heavy but holding a faint flicker of longing.
Scene 5: Falling Asleep in Despair
Ethan lay on his bed, staring at the cracked ceiling. The faint glow of the city lights seeped through his window, shifting shadows across the walls. Outside, the world buzzed on without him—cars rumbled in the distance, a faint siren wailed, and the hum of neon signs pulsed like a heartbeat.
The day replayed itself in his mind, each moment sharper than the last. Grayson’s biting words echoed, his boss’s disdain cutting deeper with every repetition. His mother’s voice came next, filled with guilt and accusation, drowning him in obligations he couldn’t fulfill. Jared’s laughter from the living room had lingered long after Ethan had shut his door, a reminder of the isolation he couldn’t escape.
He turned onto his side, curling into himself. The weight of it all pressed against his chest, a dull ache that refused to fade. He glanced at the photo of the farm on the windowsill, its edges worn and its colors faded.
The golden fields seemed impossibly far away now, a dream from another life. The harmony he’d once known there—a place where things made sense, where effort was met with purpose—felt like a cruel memory.
Is this really all there is? The thought came unbidden, quiet but persistent. He clenched his eyes shut, trying to block it out, but the question refused to leave.
His breaths came unevenly as his exhaustion deepened. Somewhere, amidst the swirling thoughts and fragmented regrets, a new one formed—a silent plea.
Please, he thought, his chest tightening. Let something change.
The hum of the city blurred into stillness. His grip on consciousness slipped, his last thought lingering like a fragile thread of hope.
