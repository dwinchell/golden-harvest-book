The Harvester’s Path is a Portal RPG Lit novel that follows Ethan, an ordinary young man thrust into an extraordinary world governed by a System. Struggling with an unfulfilled life on Earth, Ethan is summoned to a high-fantasy realm in the midst of a divine conflict between two factions of gods: the Covenant, led by Merithera, the Goddess of the Harvest, and the Zenith, led by the ambitious and manipulative Arceon.

In this world, mortals pledge to gods for power and guidance, their actions generating essence that fuels the gods’ strength. The Covenant upholds balance and community, while the Zenith promotes dominance and ambition. Ethan, disoriented and vulnerable, finds himself in a remote farming village under threat from Decay beasts, monstrous creatures spreading corruption across the land. Despite his fear, Ethan steps up to help the villagers, gradually learning to navigate the System and discovering his own potential.

Ethan encounters Lyssara, a warrior-priestess of Merithera and a leader among the Golden Scythes, an order dedicated to protecting life and maintaining balance. Lyssara takes Ethan under her wing, mentoring him in combat and Merithera’s values. Through their journey, Ethan embraces the Harvester class, a rare and symbolic role tied to Merithera’s domain, combining offensive magic and defensive resilience with themes of growth and renewal.

As Ethan grows stronger, he learns that the Decay attacks are not natural but part of a larger Zenith scheme orchestrated by Veyara, the cunning High Priestess of Thaldris, the God of Greed. The Zenith’s plan to destabilize Covenant territories unfolds, forcing Ethan and his companions—Lyssara, Kaelen, a rogue aligned with Nyssara, and Seris, a healer devoted to Elyndra—to confront Decay-infused enemies and moral dilemmas that challenge their unity.

The narrative intertwines themes of balance, resilience, and the cyclical nature of life with compelling character dynamics and strategic combat. Ethan’s growth from a hesitant, disheartened man into a confident Harvester mirrors the larger struggle between the Covenant’s ideals of collective harmony and the Zenith’s destructive ambition. Alongside action-packed battles, the story explores the characters’ motivations, relationships, and the influence of divine forces shaping their destinies.

The vibrant, System-driven world is rich with magical aesthetics, from Ethan’s scythe-shaped energy arcs to the ethereal golden hues of Merithera’s blessings. Each character embodies their divine alignment, adding depth to the interplay between personal choices and overarching conflicts.

In a climactic battle, Ethan earns Merithera’s blessing, solidifying his role as her champion. The stage is set for larger confrontations as the Zenith escalates its attacks, leading to full-scale war. The Harvester’s Path blends thrilling action, immersive worldbuilding, and emotional depth, creating a story of growth, community, and the enduring fight for balance in the face of overwhelming ambition.
