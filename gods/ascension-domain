Core Philosophy:

Followers of Arceon embrace the idea that life is a ladder, and each rung represents an opportunity to rise above others. They believe ascension is both a right and a responsibility for those with the ambition to seize it.
They view power—whether physical, social, or political—as the ultimate measure of one’s worth.
Behavior and Practices:

Competitive and Ruthless: Followers often engage in cutthroat competition, seeing it as a test of their strength and suitability for ascension. This manifests in betrayal, sabotage, and even assassination if necessary.
Obsession with Growth: Many are consumed by self-improvement, whether through combat training, accumulating wealth, or political maneuvering. Their ambition drives them to extremes, often disregarding morality.
Hierarchical Societies: Communities under Arceon’s influence are rigidly hierarchical, with the strongest or most cunning at the top. These societies often devolve into oppressive regimes, where power is hoarded by a select few.
Religious Practices:

Rites of Ascension: Ceremonies mark significant achievements, such as claiming a new title or defeating a rival. These rites often involve public displays of dominance or symbolic acts of “rising.”
Sacrificial Acts: Some extreme followers believe that taking the lives or essence of others accelerates their own ascension, leading to cult-like rituals of sacrifice.
Marks of Favor: Highly favored followers are often granted visible symbols of Arceon’s blessing, such as glowing tattoos or unique skills that amplify their dominance.
Conflict with Others:

Followers of Arceon frequently clash with those of the good gods, particularly Merithera, as their competitive and exploitative nature runs counter to her ideals of community and balance.
They actively undermine societies led by the good gods, spreading discord and turning allies against each other to weaken resistance.
Arceon’s Ambitions in the Larger Conflict
Ultimate Goal:

Arceon seeks to reshape the pantheon and the mortal world under his rule, where the strongest rise and the weak are subjugated. He views the old order as stagnant and believes his vision of unending ascension is the natural state of existence.
Tactics in the Divine Conflict:

Manipulation of Mortals: Arceon uses his cunning to sow discord among mortal societies, encouraging wars, betrayals, and internal strife. By fostering chaos, he forces mortals to choose between submission or annihilation.
Corruption of Essence: He and his followers actively seek to corrupt or consume essence from good gods and their followers, depriving his enemies of power while strengthening his own position.
Alliances with Evil Gods: Though he is the leader of the bad faction, Arceon’s alliances are pragmatic rather than ideological. He manipulates other gods in his faction, keeping them in line with promises of shared power while ensuring he remains at the top.
Role in the Mortal Conflict:

The large-scale war between good and evil factions is driven in part by Arceon’s ambition to eliminate the opposition entirely. His forces are not only monsters and dark magic but also mortal armies fueled by promises of power and ascension.
Arceon actively seeks to disrupt the balance of essence by targeting settlements under the good gods, draining their essence supply to weaken them and force their followers into submission.
Interaction with the Protagonist:

Arceon views the protagonist as a potential threat due to their growing favor with Merithera and their emerging leadership role.
He may attempt to manipulate or corrupt the protagonist, offering them power and influence in exchange for their loyalty. This presents moral dilemmas and moments of temptation that challenge the protagonist’s resolve.
As the protagonist rises in the warrior-priest society, they become a direct obstacle to Arceon’s plans, leading to escalating confrontations both on the battlefield and in the realm of divine influence.
