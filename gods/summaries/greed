Avarice: Hoarding resources and exploiting others to achieve personal gain.
Ambition: The relentless pursuit of status and influence, often at the expense of others.
Personality:
Thaldris is sly, persuasive, and ruthlessly opportunistic. He is a master manipulator who preys on the weaknesses and desires of others, offering promises of wealth and success while secretly binding them to his will. His charm and silver tongue conceal a calculating and self-serving nature. He despises altruism, viewing it as a foolish waste of potential. Thaldris revels in the chaos and corruption his influence spreads, thriving on division and competition.

Appearance:
Thaldris is depicted as a handsome but sinister figure. His golden robes are encrusted with jewels and metallic threads, designed to flaunt his wealth. His sharp features exude charisma, but his piercing eyes gleam with greed, revealing his true nature. He often carries a gilded staff or scepter, a symbol of his dominion over material wealth and ambition.

Role in the Conflict:
As a key member of the Zenith and one of Arceon’s closest allies, Thaldris plays a pivotal role in destabilizing Covenant territories. He sows discord and division among mortals, tempting them to betray their communities for personal gain. His influence is felt in economic exploitation, corruption, and the hoarding of resources. Thaldris’s machinations often fuel the Zenith’s larger strategies, making him a significant antagonist in the story.

Philosophy:
Thaldris teaches that life is a competition where only the clever and ambitious prosper. He views greed not as a vice but as the driving force of progress and power. To him, self-interest is the ultimate virtue, and generosity is a weakness to be exploited. His teachings lure followers with promises of success, often leading them into moral decay and ruin.

Blessings and Powers:

He can imbue objects with corruptive power, causing those who covet them to act irrationally.
In battle, his influence manifests as debilitating greed in his enemies, driving them to turn on one another or abandon their cause.
Allies and Influence:
Thaldris is a staunch ally of Arceon and works closely with Veskara (Decay) and Drakthar (War) to advance the Zenith’s goals. His methods often complement Veskara’s corruption and Drakthar’s brute force, creating a devastating combination of greed, decay, and destruction.

Role in the Story:
Thaldris’s schemes are central to the Zenith’s destabilization efforts. He manipulates mortals and even other gods, redirecting resources and essence to weaken the Covenant.
