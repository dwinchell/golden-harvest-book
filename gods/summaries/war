Drakthar, God of War
Domains:

Conquest: The pursuit of dominance through strength and warfare.
Bloodshed: The relentless drive to overcome enemies through combat and destruction.
Ambition: The belief that might makes right, and that power is the ultimate goal.
Personality:
Drakthar is brutal, relentless, and fiery, embodying the chaos and fervor of war. He thrives on conflict, seeing it as the ultimate test of strength and a crucible for greatness. Unlike Arceon’s calculated ambition or Thaldris’s cunning, Drakthar’s approach is direct and unyielding. He values raw power, courage, and loyalty among his followers but has little patience for weakness or diplomacy. His presence is commanding, his voice booming like a battle cry that inspires fear or awe in equal measure.

Appearance:
Drakthar is often depicted as a towering figure clad in dark, battle-scarred armor, with a jagged crown resembling the spikes of a war helm. His features are fierce, with glowing red eyes and a scarred, chiseled face that reflects his countless battles. A massive greatsword, often wreathed in flames or blood-like essence, symbolizes his dominion over war and destruction.

Role in the Conflict:
As one of Arceon’s closest allies and a core member of the Zenith, Drakthar’s role is to lead the charge in the faction’s campaigns. He commands armies of mortals and monsters, spreading fear and devastation across Covenant territories. His presence ensures that any resistance is met with overwhelming force, driving home the Zenith’s philosophy of survival of the fittest. Drakthar’s warlike nature complements Arceon’s ambition and Thaldris’s manipulation, making him a key player in the Zenith’s strategies.

Philosophy:
Drakthar teaches that strength is the ultimate virtue and that true power is earned on the battlefield. He scorns diplomacy and compromise, viewing them as tools of the weak. His followers are encouraged to embrace conflict, using it as a means to assert dominance and achieve greatness. Drakthar believes that the strong have a duty to conquer and lead, while the weak exist only to serve or perish.

Blessings and Powers:

Drakthar grants his followers enhanced physical strength, endurance, and combat prowess.
His blessings often manifest as a berserker-like fury, making his champions nearly unstoppable in battle.
He can empower weapons and armor with destructive energy, amplifying their lethality.
In battle, his influence stokes the flames of conflict, inciting rage and desperation in allies and enemies alike.
Allies and Influence:
Drakthar is a staunch supporter of Arceon’s vision and works closely with Thaldris (Greed) and Veskara (Decay) to further the Zenith’s goals. His forces often act as the Zenith’s hammer, breaking through Covenant defenses and creating chaos for his allies to exploit.

Role in the Story:
Drakthar is the primary active antagonist in Act III, leading the Zenith’s forces in a full-scale assault on Covenant territories. His brutal tactics and unwavering resolve make him a formidable foe for Ethan and his party, culminating in a climactic confrontation where his philosophy of might is directly challenged by Merithera’s ideals of balance and community. Drakthar’s presence drives the stakes higher, forcing Ethan and his allies to unite and rise to the challenge.

Drakthar’s embodiment of war and destruction provides a visceral and physical threat, contrasting with the more subtle manipulations of Thaldris and the decay of Veskara.
