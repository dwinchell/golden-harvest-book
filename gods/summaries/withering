The Goddess of Withering embodies the natural and supernatural forces of decay, decline, and the inevitable loss that follows growth and vitality. She is not simply a goddess of death; her domain is more insidious and gradual. Her influence permeates the fragile edges of life, eroding what has been built or cultivated. Despite her alignment with the Zenith, she is not entirely malevolent; rather, her perspective reflects the darker aspects of the natural cycle, unchecked by balance or renewal.

Name: Veskara
Domains:
Decay: Accelerating the natural process of deterioration in living things, environments, and civilizations.
Entropy: The inevitable breakdown of systems and structures, both physical and societal.
Loss: Emotional and physical, manifesting as despair, hopelessness, or the loss of loved ones, resources, or vitality.
Personality:
Veskara is calm, deliberate, and hauntingly poetic in her mannerisms.
She views her domain as a necessity, even a mercy, in the endless cycle of creation and destruction. However, she delights in hastening the process where it suits her purposes.
She sees herself as a counterbalance to forces like Merithera's growth and Elarion's joy, believing their unchecked influence would lead to stagnation and bloated excess.
Appearance:
Veskara is often depicted as a spectral figure draped in tattered, flowing robes that shift between the hues of dying leaves and ash.
Her face is gaunt but eerily beautiful, with sunken eyes that glow faintly with sickly green or pale gold light.
She carries a staff entwined with brittle, withered vines and a fading flower at its peak.
Followers:
Her followers are often those who have experienced great loss or despair and seek to embrace the inevitability of decline.
They include healers who have turned to spreading sickness, necromancers, and agents of entropy who infiltrate and destabilize communities.
Farmers and artisans who pledge to Veskara often do so out of desperation, seeking to curse their rivals’ crops or works to wither and fail.
Powers and Influence:
Veskara's essence spreads through blighted land, dead crops, and corrupted beings. She thrives on the neglect and overreach of others, finding her strongest foothold where balance has already faltered.
Her power allows her to sap vitality, both directly (in combat) and indirectly (by spreading rot and decay).
Her gifts to her followers include curses that weaken enemies, hasten aging, or cause environmental devastation.
Relationship to the Zenith and the Covenant:
Veskara aligns with the Zenith because she thrives on opposition to growth, harmony, and prosperity, which are hallmarks of the Covenant's dominions.
Her relationships with other Zenith gods are pragmatic. She finds synergy with Siphona (Decay) and Thaldris (Greed), as her power enhances their ambitions. However, she sometimes clashes with Arceon, as his relentless pursuit of Ascension conflicts with her belief in the inevitability of decline.
Role in the Story:
Veskara’s influence can serve as a lingering threat in the wilderness and corrupted areas Ethan and his party travel through.
She could be directly tied to the source of the Decay Ethan and Lyssara seek to destroy, either through her creatures or a blighted artifact connected to her power.
Her ideology provides a sharp philosophical counterpoint to Merithera’s balance and growth, framing the larger stakes of the conflict between the Covenant and the Zenith.
