Arceon, God of Ascension and Leader of the Zenith
Domains:

Ascension: The pursuit of power, ambition, and self-improvement at any cost.
Dominance: Leadership through force, control, and the subjugation of others.
Supremacy: The belief in a hierarchy where the strongest and most ambitious rise above all others.
Personality:
Arceon is cunning, ambitious, and authoritative, embodying the extremes of individualism and power. He is a charismatic leader with a vision of a world where only the strongest thrive, rejecting the concept of balance or community. Arceon is calculating and ruthless, willing to exploit others to achieve his goals. His charm and eloquence make him persuasive, inspiring loyalty among his followers despite his harsh methods. However, his unrelenting drive for supremacy blinds him to the consequences of his actions, leading to conflict and destruction.

Appearance:
Arceon is depicted as an imposing, regal figure. His armor gleams like polished obsidian, adorned with intricate patterns that symbolize his dominion. His eyes burn with an intense, otherworldly light, and his voice carries both authority and menace. A crown of jagged black metal rests on his head, signifying his self-proclaimed supremacy. His presence radiates an aura of power that commands respect and fear.

Role in the Conflict:
As the leader of the Zenith, Arceon orchestrated the split from the Covenant, capitalizing on a crisis to criticize Merithera’s leadership and rally other gods to his cause. He sees the Covenant’s ideals of balance and cooperation as weaknesses, believing that only through competition and dominance can the gods achieve true greatness. Arceon manipulates mortals and gods alike, using the proxy war between the Covenant and the Zenith to consolidate his power and reshape the world in his image.

Philosophy:
Arceon teaches that strength and ambition are the highest virtues. He believes that individuals should seek to rise above their peers, regardless of the cost. His philosophy rejects the notion of equality, viewing the world as a battlefield where only the fittest deserve to survive and rule. While his teachings inspire greatness in some, they also fuel greed, conflict, and division.

Allies:
Arceon is closely aligned with Veskara (God of Decay), Thaldris (God of Greed), and Drakthar (God of War). Together, they form a core group within the Zenith, each contributing to the faction’s aggressive and destructive strategies.

Antagonistic Qualities:
Arceon’s ambition and manipulation make him a formidable antagonist. He operates through proxies like Veyara and Drakthar, pulling strings from the shadows to destabilize the Covenant. His ultimate goal is to achieve unmatched dominance, even at the expense of his own followers.

Role in the Story:
Arceon’s influence is felt throughout The Harvester's Path, though he rarely appears directly. His schemes drive the central conflict, as his followers and allies execute his vision. As Ethan grows in power and understanding, the story builds toward a confrontation with Arceon’s ideals, challenging the destructive nature of unchecked ambition and dominance.

Arceon serves as the embodiment of the Zenith’s ideals and the primary force of opposition, providing a compelling counterpoint to Merithera’s philosophy of balance and growth.
