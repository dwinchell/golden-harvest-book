Merithera, Goddess of the Harvest
Domains: Growth, balance, community, and sustenance.

Personality:
Merithera embodies the virtues of nurturing, patience, and steadfastness. She is wise and compassionate, with a deep understanding of the cyclical nature of life. Her demeanor is calm and measured, but she possesses quiet strength and resolve when defending her domains. She values unity and cooperation, encouraging her followers to work together and support one another. Though benevolent, she is not without her sternness; she expects diligence and respect for the delicate balance of the world.

Appearance:
Merithera is often depicted as a tall, radiant figure with features reflecting the seasons: a golden glow reminiscent of ripe wheat, flowing hair resembling sunlight or autumn leaves, and eyes that shift between the verdant green of spring and the warm brown of fertile soil. Her attire is simple yet regal, adorned with symbols of harvest and life, such as vines, fruits, and grains.

Blessings:
Merithera grants her followers strength in cultivation, protection, and fostering life. Those blessed by her exude a warmth that inspires trust and cooperation. She empowers her champions with abilities tied to growth and renewal, such as enhancing the fertility of the land, healing wounds, and summoning constructs from natural elements.

Role in the Conflict:
As the leader of the Covenant, Merithera represents balance and order. She opposes Arceon’s ambitions, viewing his drive for dominance as a destructive force that threatens the harmony of the mortal world. Her actions are often subtle, working through her Scythes (her warrior-priest order) and key mortals like Ethan. She relies on cooperation and faith to maintain the strength of her faction, believing in the collective power of her followers.

Philosophy:
Merithera sees life as a cycle of sowing and reaping, growth and decay, toil and reward. She teaches that true prosperity comes not from hoarding or greed but from sharing and sustaining the community. This philosophy underpins her conflict with Arceon, whose faction prioritizes personal ascension and domination over balance.

Connection to Ethan:
Merithera carefully selects Ethan as a key player in the battle against the Zenith. She sees his potential to embody her ideals of growth, resilience, and community. Through subtle guidance and blessings, she steers him toward becoming her champion, a Harvester who can protect her domain and inspire others.

Merithera’s presence in the story reflects the themes of balance and the value of collective effort, providing a powerful contrast to the ambition and division embodied by Arceon and the Zenith.
