Chapter 3: Arrival in the Village
1. Setting the Scene: Approaching the Village

Description:

Ethan descends into a shallow valley where the forest transitions into fields. Some fields are lush and thriving, while others show signs of Decay: blackened patches, dying crops, and withered trees.
He notices signs of human activity—fences, scarecrows, and smoke rising in the distance.
The air grows heavier with tension as he nears the settlement, emphasizing the contrast between the idyllic wheat field he saw earlier and this struggling community.
Purpose:

Reinforce the stakes of the Decay spreading through the land.
Highlight the desperation of the local farmers and their fight for survival.
2. First Interaction: Confrontation at the Gate

Description:

Ethan approaches a watchtower at the edge of the village. Two guards step forward: a tall, sharp-featured woman (Raina) and a nervous, younger man (Finn).
Raina immediately questions Ethan’s presence, her tone suspicious and defensive. Finn appears less confident but backs her up.
Ethan explains that he’s unarmed and just looking for safety. He mentions surviving an encounter with a strange monster in the forest.
Key Moments:

Raina’s suspicion intensifies when Ethan describes the Blightling Wolf. She warns him that monsters have been appearing more frequently and that outsiders often bring trouble.
Finn hesitates but eventually convinces Raina to let Ethan through, noting that he doesn’t seem like a threat.
The guards reluctantly allow Ethan into the village but warn him not to cause problems.
Purpose:

Introduce the village’s defensive measures and the distrust bred by recent attacks.
Establish Raina and Finn as minor recurring characters, adding depth to the village’s population.
3. Ethan’s First Impressions of the Village

Description:

The village is small and bustling with activity. Farmers repair fences and tools, blacksmiths hammer together makeshift weapons, and groups of children are hurried indoors by worried parents.
Ethan notices the scars of past attacks: buildings patched with mismatched materials, hastily dug trenches, and scorch marks on the ground.
The air is filled with the sounds of hammering, murmured prayers, and the occasional distant animal cry.
Ethan’s Reflection:

He feels out of place and unsure of how he can contribute.
Seeing the villagers’ fear and determination stirs a sense of responsibility in him.
Purpose:

Immerse the reader in the village setting and its struggles.
Begin to build Ethan’s emotional connection to the people he will eventually fight to protect.
4. Learning About the Village’s Struggles

Description:

An elder named Elara approaches Ethan, having overheard his conversation with the guards. She asks him about his encounter with the Blightling Wolf.
Ethan recounts his battle, and Elara nods grimly, explaining that the village has faced similar creatures. She describes how the attacks have intensified, with crops being destroyed and villagers going missing.
Elara leads Ethan to a communal area where other villagers are gathered, discussing their plans for defense and survival.
Key Dialogue:

Villagers express their frustration and fear, lamenting the lack of help from neighboring settlements.
A farmer angrily suggests abandoning the village, but Elara insists they stay and fight for their home.
Ethan listens quietly, feeling the weight of their plight but unsure how to help.
Purpose:

Provide exposition about the Decay threat and its impact on the region.
Show the villagers’ resilience and determination to fight for their survival.
Begin to establish Ethan’s role as someone who can help, even if he doesn’t realize it yet.
