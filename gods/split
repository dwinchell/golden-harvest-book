The action in the world is driven by a conflict between two factions of gods - the Covenant and the Zenith. All gods used to be in the Covenant. Merithera is the leader of the Covenant. Arceon is the leader of the Zenith. Arceon orchestrated the split of the Zenith from the Covenant. The conflict between the two factions occurs as a proxy war between mortals. They compete for the essence generated by mortal followers, and for control over the fate of the mortal world.
