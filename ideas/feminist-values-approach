Steps to Uphold Feminist Values
1. Complex, Well-Rounded Female Characters
Avoiding Stereotypes: Female characters are written with depth and individuality, steering clear of clichés such as damsels in distress or overly sexualized figures.
Demonstrating Strength in Many Forms: Characters like Lyssara show strength through leadership and combat, while Seris showcases emotional resilience and the power of nurturing and healing.
2. Equal Relationships Based on Partnership
Balanced Dynamics: Relationships, whether romantic or platonic, are built on mutual respect and equality. For instance, Ethan and Lyssara’s evolving partnership grows from mentor-student to equals, based on shared goals and experiences.
No Power Imbalances: Interpersonal dynamics emphasize collaboration and shared agency rather than dominance.
3. Thoughtful Exploration of Power Dynamics
Pledging and Agency: The concept of pledging to gods is explored with an emphasis on cultural diversity and individual choice. This avoids portraying pledging as inherently oppressive, instead highlighting how different societies handle it.
Societal Commentary: The narrative subtly critiques inequality by showing how overly traditional societies may marginalize non-pledgers and contrasting this with more progressive norms.
4. Subverting Tropes
Diverse Roles for Women: Female characters occupy a range of roles, including mentors (Lyssara), healers (Seris), and villains (Veyara). They are integral to the plot and not defined by their relationships with male characters.
Avoiding Overused Narratives: Characters are not reduced to love interests or secondary figures but instead serve as key players in driving the story forward.
5. Showing Feminist Values Through Actions
Equality in the System: The System world inherently provides opportunities for both men and women to excel based on their choices and actions, rather than predetermined societal roles.
Subtle Critiques of Inequality: Through plot events, the story highlights the downsides of greed, corruption, and imbalance, all of which align with feminist critiques of exploitative power structures.
6. Integrating Feminist Norms Organically
Norms of Equality: Some societies within the story naturally embrace gender equality, presenting it as an unremarkable norm rather than an extraordinary exception.
Representation: Female empowerment is shown through actions, such as Lyssara leading the charge against Decay or Seris healing critical allies under pressure.
7. Highlighting Diverse Strengths
Multiple Forms of Strength: Strength is portrayed in both physical and emotional terms. Lyssara represents physical and strategic strength, while Seris embodies emotional and restorative strength.
Intersectionality: Characters are not defined by singular traits but are multidimensional, reflecting a broader spectrum of experiences and perspectives.
