The world is a "System" world where the world itself tracks stats, levels, and provides explicitly granted skills. Characters can interact with the System like in a typical RPGLit world where characters can see notifications and menus, etc.

Some of the gods created the system in ancient times to harness the power of humans to serve the gods own ends. It allows them to gain essence.

Everyone knows the gods created the system. It's a normal part of life. The events that led to its creation are mythology and may be incorrect portrayals such that humans don't know the full story
