There's a key scene where the Ethan sees Arceon's forces burn a field of grain that he watched grow and was near readiness for the harvest. He was friendly with the farmers and understands the work that went into farming it. The event drives home what Arceon is really about, and the stakes. He is disturbed by it, but then his conviction is hardened. It validates his decision to pledge to the god of the harvest. He thinks back to it later as he grows, and then even later uses it as an example to explain the importance of their work to a new follower.

Their quest to repel the monster attacks leads them to the fringes of the farming areas. The place where it happens is near a town that is the last farming community on the fringes before the wilderness. There had been escalating monster attacks. He and the warrior-priestess had begun using this town as a base of operations as they organized its defenses and went on missions to uncover and destroy the source of the monster threat. Arceon's forces realized that they were a threat to the monster plan and came to destroy the threat. They lost because they undrestimated the main character's power. In wrath after the burning, he destroyed several of them with surprising power. He is a frontline caster class and destroyed them with a flashy ability. This was the first time he took a human life. It shakes him and sickens him but looking back at the burning field he realizes that he does not regret the deed and lets go of any remorse about killing Arceon's followers.
