Purpose:

I want to subvert the RPTLit trope of lots of "beautiful women" by creating a gender balanced narrative where both men and women are described as attractive, in ways that are not solely focused on physical perfection.

Summary:

To subvert the "Lots of Beautiful Women" trope, the narrative balances descriptions of men and women, focusing on traits that reflect their personality, skills, or roles. Attractiveness is nuanced, emphasizing inner qualities like confidence, kindness, or strength. Physical beauty is contextualized within cultural standards and tied to the character's role, avoiding overemphasis on perfection or objectification. Both genders are described with equal care, showcasing realistic features, including flaws that enhance their relatability. Romantic appeal is mutual, with admiration shared across genders. Supporting characters of all genders are depicted as attractive in varied, respectful ways, reflecting diverse beauty ideals. This approach creates a rich, inclusive world where attractiveness stems from individuality and depth rather than superficial traits, aligning with the story's feminist values.

Approach:

1. Balanced Descriptions of Attractiveness
Physical Attributes for Both Genders: When describing characters, focus equally on the physical traits of men and women. Highlight features that reflect their personality, skills, or roles rather than adhering to traditional notions of beauty.

Example (Male): “Kaelen’s sharp features and piercing gaze carried a quiet intensity, as though he saw the world in ways others couldn’t.”
Example (Female): “Seris’s calm presence and graceful movements gave her an understated elegance, her radiant smile reflecting her inner warmth.”
Nuanced Attractiveness: Instead of focusing on perfection, emphasize features that give characters personality. Scars, weathered skin, or tired eyes can contribute to their allure by hinting at their stories.

2. Attractiveness Tied to Strengths
Inner Qualities: Describe characters as attractive because of their confidence, intelligence, compassion, or skill.

Example: “Ethan’s quiet determination, even in the face of overwhelming odds, lent him a charm that went unnoticed by himself but not by others.”
Role-Specific Appeal: Characters can be described as attractive in ways tied to their roles or skills.

Example: “Lyssara’s disciplined stance and the fluidity of her movements in battle made her presence commanding, her golden cloak a symbol of strength and grace.”
3. Avoid Overemphasis on Physical Beauty
Functional Descriptions: Focus on physical traits in contexts that feel natural and tied to the character’s role.
Example: Lyssara’s toned arms might be described in the context of her combat training, while Seris’s steady hands could reflect her precision as a healer.
Non-Gendered Descriptions: Avoid making beauty a defining trait for women while ignoring it for men. Both genders should be described with equal care and attention to detail.
4. Show Diversity in Attractiveness
Varied Standards: Reflect different cultural standards of attractiveness within the world. Some societies may value physical strength, while others might find intelligence or eloquence appealing.

Example: “In the Verdant Pact, the sharpness of one’s instincts and the grace of their movements were considered far more attractive than physical appearance.”
Non-Traditional Features: Highlight traits not typically associated with beauty, such as a charismatic smile, expressive eyes, or a soothing voice.

5. Equal Representation in Romantic Appeal
Balance Romantic Interest: Make it clear that men are equally admired for their appearance, charm, and demeanor.
Example: “Kaelen’s quiet confidence and the mischievous glint in his eyes often drew attention, though he never seemed to notice.”
Shared Admiration: Have characters admire one another equally across genders.
Example: Lyssara might admire Ethan’s growing courage, while Ethan reflects on Lyssara’s strength and compassion.
6. Highlight Flaws as Part of Attractiveness
Realism in Descriptions: Show imperfections that enhance characters’ relatability while contributing to their allure.
Example: “The faint scar running across Kaelen’s cheek was a reminder of battles fought, lending his sharp features a rugged charm.”
Example: “Lyssara’s sun-weathered skin and calloused hands were marks of her devotion, making her beauty all the more authentic.”
7. Balance in Secondary Characters
Attractive Men and Women in Supporting Roles: Ensure both genders are equally described as attractive across the narrative, including non-romantic characters.
Example: A male village guard could have a striking build that speaks of dedication, while a female blacksmith might have a magnetic presence and strength.
8. Avoid Objectification
Respectful Tone: Avoid descriptions that focus solely on physical traits, especially in ways that feel gratuitous. Let the characters’ actions and personalities shine through.
Example (Positive): “Her confident stride and unwavering gaze carried an allure that was as much about her spirit as her appearance.”
Example (Avoid): “Her flawless skin and perfectly curved figure caught every eye in the room.”
