The actions of mortals can create essence (a tangible quantity of power) for the gods they pledge to. Essence empowers the gods. Gaining much of it is one way to increase favor. Killing other beings including monsters and humans grants an amount of essence comensurate with the power of the being that was killed. Other activities also generate essence though - harvesting a field would generate essence for the god of the harvest. Crafting an item would generate essence for a god of artisanry. A war god would get extra essence from combat.

Essence is automatically accumulated and allocated directly to the gods based on human actions. Humans cannot use it in any way. Gods may choose to reward their followers with extra bonuses by spending essence. Or gods can use it to exercise their powers. Theoretically if a god ran low enough on essence they could be vulnerable to being destroyed by other gods

Because of the essence system, the split in the divine factions resulted in conflict among humans.
