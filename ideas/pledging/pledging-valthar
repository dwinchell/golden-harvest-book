In Valthar, strict adherence to the gods of The Zenith underscores the nation’s devotion to power and ambition. Here’s how this policy can be incorporated into the society:

Valthar’s Policy on Pledging:
Mandatory Pledging:

Every citizen of Valthar is required to pledge to a god of The Zenith by a specific age, typically during a grand coming-of-age ceremony.
Failure to pledge is considered treason against the gods and the nation.
Enforcement:

Individuals who refuse to pledge are viewed as threats to the divine order and the state.
Such individuals are publicly executed as a demonstration of the nation’s unwavering loyalty to The Zenith.
Cultural Justification:

Valthar society believes that power flows directly from the gods, and anyone unaligned is seen as a weak link that undermines the strength of the nation.
The Zenith’s ideology promotes the idea that non-pledgers are not only useless but actively disruptive to the divine hierarchy.
Ceremonial Integration:

The pledging ceremony is a lavish, intimidating event designed to emphasize the gods' power and the individual’s obligation to align with that power.
Priests, warriors, and rulers observe the pledges, ensuring that every individual submits to the divine will.
Punishment for Dissent:

Non-pledgers are hunted down by special enforcers known as Wardens of Ascension, who eliminate anyone who defies the state’s mandate.
Impact on Society:
Social Uniformity:

Valthar’s society is highly uniform, with no tolerance for dissent or deviation from the divine order.
This creates an atmosphere of fear and conformity, where people are compelled to align with The Zenith’s values.
Cultural Consequences:

Art, literature, and education glorify the gods of The Zenith and the nation’s power.
Individual identity is tied to one’s god and their role within the divine hierarchy.
Potential Plot Hooks:

A secret group of dissenters within Valthar might be plotting to escape or subvert the system.
The protagonist could encounter a survivor who narrowly escaped execution for refusing to pledge, offering insight into Valthar’s harsh policies.
The protagonist might face moral dilemmas in opposing such a rigid and brutal system.
