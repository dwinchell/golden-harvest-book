Humans as a rule do not oppose the gods openly. They would probably be crushed. The farthest they are likely to go is choosing to remain unaligned. In highly traditional societies they would be outcasts. In more progressive societies they would just be viewed as weird and maybe foolish. They might even be able to found a group of likeminded individuals but would be unlikely to have any significant effect on the world.
