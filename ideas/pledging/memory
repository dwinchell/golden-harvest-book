In Golden Harvest, humans can choose to pledge themselves to a specific god, which is tracked by the system. They receive certain benefits but also penalties or even punishments if they defy the god they have pledged to or go against Their tenets.

In Golden Harvest, most humans pledge to a god for various reasons. The gods benefit from having followers and have arranged incentives to encourage pledging. Some few humans do not pledge, and how they are perceived varies by culture. Cultural differences also influence how and when people pledge. In some areas, pledging is done as a child, as soon as they can operate the system, and they are encouraged to pledge to the same god (or goddess) as their parents and community. In other areas, pledging is a coming-of-age ritual where a young adult makes an important choice about the direction of their life.

In Golden Harvest, in communal pledging areas, non-pledgers are seen as threatening the fabric of the community. These places are generally strongly religious and strictly traditional.

In Golden Harvest, in ritualistic pledging areas, there is a coming-of-age ritual that most people participate in. As they approach adulthood, they are taught about the different gods, their expectations of humans, and the direction in life that pledging would take them. The ritual also involves choosing a class.

In Golden Harvest, most classes can pledge to any god, but there are restrictions. For instance, a god of healing would not accept a necromancer.

In Golden Harvest, a non-combat-focused class would have difficulty gaining the favor of a war god after pledging.
